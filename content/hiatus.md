# Hello from Markdown

Well, its been over a year since my last post... Woops! I started this blog with the good intentions of staying up to date with interesting things going on in my life but that quickly derailed. This time around I'm going to make an effort to post consistently with trip reports as I do them. Plus, I'm also putting in a conscious effort to bring my camera outside with me more often which should also give me some extra motivation to post as I won't be worried about boring people with walls of unbroken text. I've noticed with other platforms such as Instagram, its a nice way to see a quick photo of a trip and bring back some of the memories, but with this blog I hope to fully capture the moment, so that the smaller details aren't lost in time. As much as I hope anyone following this blog enjoys the content, it's for me as much as it is for you. With that being said, I have a lot of potential content with over a year of my life to write about! Stay tuned.
