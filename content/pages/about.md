# Who am I?

I'm a Kelowna native but thrive anywhere on the West Coast. I love anything outside and try to be there as much as possible. I’m a skier first and foremost, but also enjoy climbing, backpacking, biking, running and more! Really, I just try to say yes to everything and experience as much in this life as I can. I love the mountains and their complexity, and spend as much time as possible with them. After getting into longer days in the backcountry I have been getting into endurance athletics and adventure racing, savouring the physical and mental challenge. Although I’m not trying to take things too seriously, I do believe no goal is too big with an open mind and the right dedication, and I apply this positive approach to the rest of my life with a healthy dose of optimism as well. This site consists of a blog with trip reports serving as a future memoir for myself as well as the odd gear review or DIY component. I've morphed it with a personal portfolio as well, and you can see a detailed write up on projects I've worked on, as well as access my CV. I am by no means a professional writer, but I hope you will enjoy reading through my stories and opinions.

Professionally, I am a recent (2020) Mechanical Engineering graduate at the University of British Columbia and registered EIT with a desire for continuous learning and challenging projects. I’m data centric, with a strong attention to detail. I enjoy working in creative, fast paced environments, learn new concepts quickly, and deliver under pressure. I am very driven, and find the most reward from completing difficult tasks. I have experience with both product and software development, where in my co-ops I was tasked with product design work, technical writing, cross-team communication, presentations, managing budgets and timelines, and participating in the development process from start to finish. I was introduced to coding during my degree by taking Java courses, and then continued to self-teach Python and HTML/CSS in parallel with my studies. To further my education, I have also taken Udemy courses for Python, HTML/CSS, and JavaScript. I strive to keep furthering my knowledge and am not afraid to take on new endeavors or wear many hats. My degree has given me a diverse skillset including management, problem solving, technical ability, progressive thinking as well as being equally comfortable in both a team based or individual role. For a full list of my skills please refer to my CV, which can be accessed through the header at the top of the page. Outside of school I have also built up my teamwork and communication skills through my work experience, where over 7 years of lifeguarding and customer service has directly given me experience in both leadership and support roles in dynamic settings. During my degree I worked at the local ski and bike shop as a sales associate and technician, where my time out on the floor has taught me how to ask relevant questions and directly connect with others. My passion shows through both my personal projects as well as leisure activities, and in my free time I’m skiing, biking, or hiking. My time in the backcountry has engrained self-discipline and determination during many multi-day trips or all-day efforts.
