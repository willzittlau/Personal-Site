# Who am I?

I am a recent (2020) Mechanical Engineering graduate at the University of British Columbia and registered EIT. I love anything outside and try to be there as much as possible. I’m a skier first and foremost, but also enjoy climbing, backpacking, biking, running and more! Really, I just try to say yes to everything and experience as much in this life as I can. I love the mountains and their complexity, and spend as much time as possible with them. After getting into longer days in the backcountry I have been getting into endurance athletics and adventure racing, savouring the physical and mental challenge. Although I’m not trying to take things too seriously, I do believe no goal is too big with an open mind and the right dedication, and I apply this positive approach to the rest of my life with a healthy dose of optimism as well. This blog consists of trip reports serving as a future memoir for myself as well as the odd gear review or DIY component. I am by no means a professional writer, but I hope you will enjoy reading through my stories and opinions.
