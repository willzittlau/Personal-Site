Right after grad I was in a weird place in life. Suddenly lots of free-time and no structure. I wanted to ski a ton but with early COVID precautions frowning upon big backcountry missions I was keeping it local. Then the idea came around of a human powered summit. I would bike to Big White with my skis, tour to the top, and ski back down and then ride back into town. This isn't an uncommon thing to do in ski resort towns, however the ride from my house to Big White is 70km and 2000m+ elevation gain so I hadn't heard of anyone doing a ride like this in Kelowna. With an open weekend ahead I made the call at around 9pm the night before and started packing. Ski carry was pretty easy with 3 ski straps, one around the head tube and tips, one through seat rails and mid ski, and one at the end holding the skis tight together. I lasted my skins onto each of the fork blades and stuffed clothes in the framepack. I called some friends last minute and was stoked when Carter said he was in!

Meeting at my place the next morning, we headed out at around 6. Really the ride wasn't too eventful, just endless climbing for the next 5 hours. My quads felt like they were about to pop (I'd been dealing with an overuse injury for the past week) so we took lots of stretch breaks. The hardest section is definitely coming up to the Big White road turn off, but the worst was up above Gem Lake as it doesn't let off and you're pretty gassed by that point. Making full use of Carter's condo, we took a breather, made fresh food and warmed up inside while we changed into ski gear. 

Next came the tour up the hill. I probably looked pretty funny touring in only bike bibs and a windbreaker but it got the job done. We meandered our way up Serwa's and then above T Bar to the top of Cliff Chair. It was really cold with the minimal layers we had on so we didn't stick around for long. Late season, early afternoon had us skiing on the worst snow I'd skiied that season but that was okay. After scraping our way back down to the condo we ditched the boots for bike shoes once again and began the funnest part of the day, ripping back to Kelowna at mach 1 on our 2000m descent. You can literally not pedal from the recycling depot to the bottom of the hill before the turn off if you wanted! Back in Kelowna on the bike paths we got some weird looks and jokes saying we were going the wrong direction for skiing, little did they know we were actually on the return trip. Overall it ended up being around 145k and 2600m+. It was 80% biking and 20% skiing, ideally that ratio would be flipped, but still a great day nonetheless!
