2020 pre-pandemic started off amazing. Right after New Year's I took my Ops 1 up in Smither's BC with one of my good friends.  Hungover, I began the 1000km drive due north from Kelowna. Battling winter roads (the theme of driving on this trip) I stopped in Quesnel and picked up Chris.  The drive wasn't very eventful besides being sheet ice for approximately 200km. Oh, and we stopped in Fraser Lake for food at a joint called Senior Duggies, where we had the pleasure of being served by Duggie himself. The food was average at best, but the character of the place and the owner makes it a worthy rest stop. (Example, he asked if we were "boarders", we assumed snowboarders but he actually meant boogie boarders, turns out he lived in Mexico for over 10 years but boogie boarded instead of surfed <span>&#128514;</span>)

Pulling into Smithers, we walked around the town for a bit before meeting up with Chris's friend from raft guiding, went out for dinner, and stayed at their place for the night. The next morning we got dropped off at the airport for our meet-up and heli shuttle up to the Chalet. I was really excited as I'd never been in a helicopter before, and after the rest of the crew found that out, graciously offered me the front seat! Visibility wasn't great and it was snowing hard, but a window opened up and we flew in. It had been absolutely nuking the past couple days, and we snuck in right in the middle of the storm. We had to circle around because the hut got dusted by a size 4 peeling off of Loft peak (photo below, the slide came off of the center glacier and pulled down the entire face). It was going to be an exciting week for sure.

Once at the lodge we shuttled our stuff in and got set up. Me and Chris were on the first flight in and got lucky enough for first dibs on a room. After settling in, the course began. Ops is a pretty intensive week, with classroom hours being well over 12 hours a day. I'm glad we took the hut-based option, as I believe the learning is way more intimate than a course at a resort would have been.  It couldn't have happened without the Chalet staff, Cristoph, Sean and Monica. Cristoph is a gnarled man who fits the textbook picture of a weathered alpinist and has an endless wealth of knowledge. I guess that'll happen after guiding in Alaska for over a decade... Sean is a younger guide but comes with a ton of experience and I appreciated his straight-forward approach to instruction and giving immediate honest feedback, whether it was good or bad. Monica was our chef for the week and makes unbelievably good meals, and most impressively cooks everything using a woodfire stove. Managing temperature control by changing burn rates and amounts was truly impressive to watch. The course layout went like this: Wake up around 6am, go outside to the weather plot for morning weather obs. Over breakfast, discuss the forecast and make a plan for the day. Make lunch to go and spend the next few hours out in the field digging pits, terrain selection, and best of all, SKIING! Back at the hut, do evening weather obs, and cover new course material over dinner. After dinner was a relaxed, social environment and we had an amazing group. Living in close proximity with 12 people was bound to get tense but actually everyone got along really well which great. The basement sauna was a key nightly routine, followed by card games and drinks before bed.

Chris and I figured out a system to get some extra sleep, noticing the morning traffic jam starting at 6 each day. Breakfast was at 7, so if we slept until 6:30 and let everyone shuffle out the door, by the time we went out for weather obs we'd basically have the station to ourselves and be done just in time for the morning lesson! Call us slackers but work smarter, not harder right? The terrain around the Chalet is stunning, and has everything from big alpine features to mellow, well gladed trees.  Oh, and that storm I mentioned? It dropped well over a metre of snow in 48 hours, offering up some of the best skiing I've had. However, combine that with buried surface hoar from a week prior and we had an extremely reactive snow pack. Natural activity was evident all around, and almost all of our stability tests produced something. The local guide and resource operations were all reporting numerous slides all size 3+ on the InfoEx, both natural and triggered. It was all you could ask for in an avalanche course, as we actually got to see may of the topics described instead of conceptually visualizing them. After the storm we were met with clear skies and rapidly dropping temps (-20 on the day we left). So we also got a huge variety of weather.

Unlike the usual course format, where a skill is tested each day, our instructors opted to save the last day as a marathon of tests, so our exam was basically an entire day long (a bit stressful!). However, this gave us plenty of time to practice and solidify skills before being tested on them.  The examinations are as follows: Weather Observations, Snow Profiles, Avalanche Rescue, Avalanche Hazard identification, Written Exam, and quality of Fieldbook notes. Words of advice for anyone taking the course: Make sure your pit walls are laser cut and straight, write down everything in your fieldbook, and openly say why you are making a certain decision whether it's related to route-finding, observation, or pit building. Overall I didn't find the course too stressful and managed to get a pretty high grade, but definitely come prepared.

<span><b>Memorable highlights of the trip:</b></span><li>Unbelievably deep skiing (literally tits deep)<li>Falling in a tree-well during my rescue exam and having to self extract while still being timed on my rescue (I still passed with lots of time to go, I was just exhausted by the end of it) <span>&#128517;</span><li>Our Russian classmate cranking the dry sauna to 110+ degrees and still calling it cold compared to back home. Everyone else could barely handle 5 minutes.<li>Cristoph flexing on all of us, doing pull up sets on the 3mm edge hanging in the kitchen that had been greased by decades of being next to the stove. None of us could even pull a full one before slipping off.

Overall I really recommend this course to anyone who wants to further their knowledge past AST1. I think its better value than AST2 if you're that committed to learning about avalanche safety and forecasting, and gives you a professional industry certification.  I had an amazing week and would almost call it a vacation even with all of the intense learning involved, it was such a special experience. The funniest thing to me is a took so many pictures but not a single one of our pits, even though it was an avalanche course and we dug countless ones. Ohwell. Coming home and saying bye to everyone was bittersweet, after spending a week locked in the same couple hundred square feet with people you become pretty close. We had a last beer together at Smithers brewing and were on our way. We didn't start making the drive until 4pm when it was getting dark so I had the lovely experience of whiteknuckling it all night long to Quesnel. Our 5 hour drive tuned into 8 because of sheet ice and unplowed roads, but we made it. Thank f**ing god for 4wd and new tires. The next morning Chris showed me around to a day at the local hill, Troll Mountain, where it had dumped over 40cms overnight (The storm that we drove through). I can honestly say it was the funnest resort day I've had, Chris knows all the hidden spots so we literally had an entire day of fresh tracks. That night I made the return trip to Kelowna.
