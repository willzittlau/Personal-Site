Me and Quin were gearing up for another work weekend adventure in early July, with big goals in mind. Mount Tupper sits at 2804 m tall in Rogers Pass BC, an area which hosts endless alpine objectives all year round as well as my favourite ski touring zones. The trip was planned extremely last minute, discussed over broken up texting throughout the day before while at work. After quickly packing we both were ready - alpine racks consisting of 2 sets of nuts, a single rack of hexes, a single rack of cams, 8 or so runners, 2 axes and one 60 m rope, all split between us (definitely a little over kill but it was going to be our first alpine summit). At this point it was already 8PM so by the time we finally got to the pass it was already 11.

Our original plan was to camp at Illecillewaet Campground but unfortunately, it was full. A quick drive over to Loop Brook gave the same results. Not really sure what to do and with no plan C, we kind of just drove around the pass for a while looking for a potential place to camp. Car camping on the highway in national parks is illegal, so we opted to drive back to the entrance of Glacier National Park and find a FSR to camp on. Just outside of the park boundary we stumbled upon the Tangier FSR and set up camp for the night. I checked my phone and it was already 12:30 AM - giving us a generous 3 and a bit hours of sleep until our 4am wakeup.

After an early start greeted by hordes of flies while prepping our oatmeal and coffee, we quickly re-sorted out our gear and packed up. Before we knew it, we were at the trailhead by the Hermit parking pullout. The approach to Hermit Meadows is nice and direct, with 800m+ elevation gain in a short 3 kilometres via steep forest switchbacks until you eventually pull into the alpine. We polished off the approach in just over an hour and took a quick rest and resupply by the stream running through camp. Here we met a party of 2 girls also planning on summiting Tupper that day, who had left from the parking lot sometime before us. After filling up our bottles and eating some bars we were on our way, continuing along the trodden in snow path that led out to the right and down into a gorgeous alpine bowl. Although the sun wasn't baking up the snow yet, it was already 15 degrees and most of the lower elevation stuff was still a dense slush, so from here on we got to enjoy post-holing and somewhat perilous snow bridge creek crossings across the rotten snowfields. Eventually after steadily gaining vertical you will hit a moraine which will take you up to the final snow slopes below the crest.

The snow eventually firmed up as we entered the morning shadow cast by Tupper's ridgeline, and I was suddenly glad on the decision of bringing axes as the snow steepened. Neither of us owned crampons, so we carefully stepped in depressions left by previous footsteps where we could no longer kick steps with our hiking boots. Eventually we made it just below the crest and were met with 2 options: a) climb the 5m high quickly softening ice wall with our lack of proper ice tools, or b) scramble around the side of it on very easy terrain along an obvious path. Naturally, we took to option A with reckless abandon clawing our way up while wielding only one general mountaineering axe each. After punching our way up with our free hand followed by setting the axe to kick shallow, questionable foot placements in our soaked hiking boots we had officially completed our first ice climb... (okay maybe it wasn't quite in the realm of a real ice route but it was good fun regardless). Now that we had gained the crest, Tupper's striking West Ridge opened up before us.

From here a short easy walk takes you along the crest until the scrambling slowly ramps up to easy 3rd and 4th over the large quartzite blocks. Continue your way along, taking the easiest path until you eventually come up to a large split block. We climbed down through a body width wide crack in the center of the block (had to take the packs off) and then down climbed to the following ledge tucked in at the corner. Below there will be a couloir that drops away and a slab section off to the left. Here is where you can find a pair of bolts that we used as a belay station and roped up for the first time. This is where I opted to put on proper rock shoes, and from here kept them on until the summit. Just around the corner is your first taste of real exposure as you traverse across the thin slab section until it gains better and better ledges. Pro is good if you do plan on roping up for it, and was mainly protected with midsized nuts and smaller cams. In reality the traverse is no harder than low 5th for maybe 10m until you gain the wider ledges, but for our first taste of real exposure I'm happy with our decision of bringing out the rope. After getting belayed across, I stowed the rope and we continued on our way. The difficulty stays pretty steady at 4th and 5th class, until you reach the prominent gendarme known as the Hermit. From the Hermit you climb down just below and off to the right, and follow another ledge system that gradually heads up towards the last crux before the summit tower.

Eventually you will come across another pair of rap/belay bolts which protect the hardest pitch. Above the bolts is a steepening wall which can either be summited via either the two 5.6 hand-plus sized cracks off to the left, a direct 10m chimney which isn't very inviting (5.3) or the corner which is also graded at 5.3. Originally we had planned to climb the cracks up but we quickly realized that we hadn't brought enough wide pieces to safely protect them, and Quin opted to just gun up the chimney as it was the most direct. There was a seized cam at the base in which he clipped into and then also managed to slot a piece halfway up. The chimney really isn't that bad but definitely felt a lot harder than 5.3, which probably says something about grade inflation these days. After whatever route you choose, you only have a few more low 5th moves up more quartzite steps until you finally get to the large flat ledge below the final summit block. From here the summit is protected by a 5.3 corner with lots of exposure (fun!!!) and some more easy 5th to get you up to the top. We once again opted to rope up but after climbing it I would recommend just short roping it to save some time if you felt comfortable on the terrain below it - the 5.3 section is very short and the only real challenge is the exposure (air beneath your feet all the way down to the glacier). Congratulations, after this last push you've gained the surprisingly flat summit of Tupper!

The summit that day couldn't have been better, clear endless blue skies, temps in the low 20s, and only a slight breeze. It offers gorgeous views in all directions, and we were lucky enough to have it all to ourselves. You can see Highway One splitting the valley more than a vertical kilometer below where we started the day early that morning more than 7 hours ago. You also get a bird's eye view of the Camels, the seldom climbed tower behind Tupper which offers even more exposure. Below you are the the large Swiss and Tupper glaciers, with a clear skyline view behind them of Mt Rogers, Grant, Fleming, Swiss and Truda, (a gorgeous traverse already on my to-do list) as well as Hermit. Farther off in the distance you can even see the large pyramid of Sir Donald towering above Mt Macdonald in the foreground. All of this results in a gorgeous sensory overload in which I've etched into my memory. Locked in ecstatic grins, we exchanged high fives and cheered into the wind for our success. Unfortunately, there was one damper to our summit high. We had expected another water refill higher up on the ridge from snowmelt, but the majority of the trek was already bone dry above the glacier so we were finding ourselves without water. After numerous photos, entries in the summit register and a quick snack, we were off again.

Just above the corner that gained you the summit, there is a rappel station into which we threaded the rope for our first rappel. After this we down climbed our way back to the top of the crux pitch and roped in for our second rappel. After this rap you link into the belay bolts below the pitch and rap off of those another rope length down. Here we ran into the two girls from camp who were making the decision to push up the crux or call it and head back. They had roped up for many of the easier 5th sections below which had slowed them down, so they decided to turn back with us. We continued on down across ledges until we saw a horn covered in rap tat. For most, this will be your last rappel. It should start above and off to climbers right of the slab traverse. From here you can either lower down to the wider ledges beside the slab and retrace your steps back - once again traversing the slab and then following the rest of the ridge back down until you reach the crest; or you can continue the rappel down past the ledges into a narrow couloir. Note of caution, this rappel was just about at the 30m mark and there was still a good amount of snow filling in the chute, so if you opt for this descent route later in the summer make sure to knot your ends! After landing in the couloir we climbed back out of it up a set of quartzite steps. To re gain the ridge there is one final airy traverse, only 5m or so but the ledge is only half of a foot wide and rounds a corner so the holds are blind! Take a deep breath, the rock is solid. This second option circumnavigates the traverse and also moves you past some longer 5th class sections and joins you back into not so bad down climbing until it gradually gets easier and easier and you're back at the crest. If you ever think you've gone off route, just look for the stark contrast of coloured cordage and webbing against the rock as there are many well dressed blocks on your way down.

We took option 2 and I believe it saved us a good amount of time on the descent. The girls behind us retraced the ascent route and we didn't see them again until we were almost back at camp, where they could be seen just descending from the crest. At this point, back on the lower ridgeline, we were starting to really feel the effects of sun exposure and dehydration. Picking up the pace by boot sliding our way down the sunbaked and slushy snow slopes below the crest, we even got to throw in a few practice self arrests whenever we slipped and picked up speed towards the drop offs. Before we knew it, we were already back trudging our way down the moraine. From here we took a detour towards a runoff and gladly refilled our bladders and polished off the rest of our packed food. Once again on the move, we trudged back into the bowl through shin deep slush. Most of the snow bridges which we had crossed that morning had collapsed in the sun, forcing our return route to be a bit more creative and a lot less direct. Nevertheless, soon enough we were trotting back through camp where we were greeted by a few parties just setting up for the night.

It was already well into the evening and we still had another 3km of steep hiking down from the meadows, so we didn't waste any time. At the edge of the snowline the trail had transformed, and we were surrounded by a sea of bone white night blooming flowers which just added to the ethereal feel of the whole day. As the forest engulfed us the light was becoming more and more dim. Our tired legs were pushed to move faster and we speed hiked our way down the winding path, in a quickening race against daylight. We had headlamps stowed, but wanted to finish hard as its always a fun challenge to commit to goals, no matter how trivial they are. Our pace had turned into a full jog by the last kilometer, and as the pathway opened up onto the highway I raced Quin out at full sprint back to the truck. My watch read 9:30pm, a full 15 hours from when we had left that morning. Not exactly a FKT, but a respectable time for our first day alpine climbing.

After a celebratory beer, a bag of chips, and lots of Gatorade, we stripped off our soaked boots and socks and piled everything into the bed. I made the bold decision in Revelstoke of continuing on home, and geared up at McDonald's with coffee and food for the long drive ahead. It may have only been two hours, but the drive seemed to stretch on for an eternity as I constantly had to battle sleep. Finally, we were back. After dropping off Quin I realised it had already been more than a 20 hour day since waking up, and quickly lowered my tired body into bed as soon as I was home. Although my muscles were already stiff and complaining, I couldn't wait to head back and experience another long day in the mountains.
