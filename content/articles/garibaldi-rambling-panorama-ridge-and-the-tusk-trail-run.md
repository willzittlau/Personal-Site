Two weeks after JDF I found myself entering another weekend without any plans. A co-worker had just hiked up in the meadows and recommended going up there as all the wildflowers had just started blooming. I had really been wanting to spend a day up there in the summer since doing the Neve, so I didn't need much more convincing. I quickly packed and shoved the last of my gels from the last two long runs into my vest and set my alarm.

I hadn't really looked at any beta whatsoever, so I was in no rush when getting up in the morning. At around 8:30 I rolled up to the rubble creek trailhead, and was shocked that I grabbed one of the last roadside parking spots. I knew that the ridge was a popular hike, but hadn't seen the extent of Instagram's blown out spots in the lower mainland yet. Soon after parking I was on my way up the switchbacks.

This section was pretty uneventful, I was jog-walking and not burning myself out on the 1000m climb. Still, I must've passed about 200 hundred people on the way up, it was ridiculous how many hikers there were. Just over an hour later, I broke out into the meadows. Here I stopped to refill water and take a quick break at the first creek I saw, and then continued on my way towards the ridge.

Before long I was transitioning from dirt to talus and the trail steepened dramatically. I slowed down again and hiked up the last climb to the top of the ridge. I looked back at the sprawling line-up of hikers and was surprised to see another couple runners up on their way, and got passed by one of them on the climb. And then, I was at the top. There's a reason why this hike is so popular, the view really is breathtaking. Garibaldi lake is absolutely stunning and has such a stark contrast against the sprawling glaciers and peaks behind. I hung out here for a while and enjoyed the view while resting. It was still early, so I decided to add some adventure and follow the ridge back down into the valley instead of retracing my steps on the trail. Steep scree descents ensued, I was cautious about rolling an ankle. I even got a bonus of glissading down some snow, although I had to kick steps down the latter half as it steepened (front pointing is not a ton of fun in trail runners).

Back at the bottom of the valley, I beelined it straight back to the trail junction at end of the meadows. Still with plenty of time left in the day, I filled up on water and nutrition again and took the junction towards the Tusk. I was definitely getting tired so I hiked pretty much the entire climb this time but still made good progress. The scree elevator seemed endless but soon enough I was rapping around the lower flanks of the peak. Here I encountered another lineup to climb the 3rd class gulley up to the summit. I hadn't planned on the tusk that day so I hadn't brought a helmet, but I wished for it now with everyone on the route kicking stuff off. And so I waited a solid 30 minutes for people to filter through before the route was clear and raced up. Halfway up a group started descending so I wrapped over to the right off route and scrambled up the choss fest before linking back onto the climbers trail to avoid the rockfall.

The view from the summit was better than the ridge, because you still got a view of the lake but also the whole valley in front of the ridge as well. I took it all in and enjoyed the summit to myself before beginning the descent back down. Luckily I tagged onto the back of a group who had started down a few minutes earlier so I got to avoid the rockfall this time. Racing back down the scree slope was a big highlight of the day, a mix between freefalling and glissading back down brought me back to the junction in 1/10th of the time it took to get up.

Still with a bit of energy to spare, I veered left down the garibaldi lake trail and endured the switchbacks to the lake for a quick dip. My aching muscles appreciated the glacial water and rejuvenated my energy. The rubble creek descent wore on me and the switchbacks didn't feel any less endless than when I descended from the Neve. Finally I was down and back at the truck, where I took a quick nap in the back before driving home (with a quick pitstop at Mag's for some much needed calories).

In total the day was about 35Km with somewhere between 2500-3000m of vert, my watch messed up the baro reading when I went for a swim with it so unfortunately it read 6000+. Below is a quick edit I made of the day + a link to the strava run.
