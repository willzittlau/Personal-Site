Summer flew by, and now that I'm back in school I'll have more time to reflect on the last 8 months and hopefully write more of my thoughts down. 2019 was my first year of really running, keeping consistent with running multiple times a week. In February I signed up for my first 50K at Bigwhite, largely because of the low cost ($45, less than $1/km), and also because that's my home ski hill and running up there is gorgeous. I didn't really start training until well into the spring after ski season had winded down, but big pushes like the Neve had already given me a pretty solid base for vert and low effort endurance. By April I was ramping up to 40k/wk. I was stoked when Quin and Matt decided to join me with some later sign-ups too. One highlight in the weeks leading up to it was driving up to Squamish and joining in on the Coast Mountain Trail series orientation runs, incredibly well put together by-donation events and a great way to share some longer runs with new friends. I'll definitely have to get out to one of Gary's races in the next couple seasons. My peak training load was around 70km in a week with 3000m of vert about 3 weeks out from the race. Before I knew it, it was race weekend.

I carpooled up to Bigwhite in the rain with Quin the night before, where we prepped our bags and tried to relax as much as possible. The next morning, we were up early to thankfully no rain and drove down to the starting area. Here we met Matt and chatted while time counted down. 10.. 9.. 8… and we were off! The first portion of the course followed cross country trails and access roads through the forests below the resort. I purposely made the point of not studying the course profile before the race, only quickly glancing at the overall route, to keep some element of surprise throughout the race (you can’t dread what you don’t know is coming) It was about 20k with ~500m if I remember correctly, which was a surprisingly mellow start to the day. However, this section soaked us to the bones. The previous week had seen a steady rain, which absolutely drenched the waist high grass and muddied up the roads. This was to be the theme of the day. Not surprisingly, Matt dropped us after only about 10km and that was the last time we'd see hi until the finish line. Anyways, after running up the road back to the starting area, we began the short climb into the village and the long descent down to gem lake, where it was extremely tempting to open up on the consistent downhill grade but we knew better and saved our quads for what was to come, instead settling into a nice 10kph pace down the 6k cat track.

After cruising down to the base of gem we hit the aid station and took a moment to relax, now almost 30k into our run. The next section was going to be the biggest climb of the day, 800m straight up one of the ski runs, climbing though waist thick brush and straddling felled trees while being gorged on by flies. I really appreciate that they added this as a part of the course instead of just following a winding cat track up to the summit. Instead, they literally flagged either side of the run and let it be anything goes, scramble up however you can, adding some character to the race. I bonked hard on this section and entered the first really mentally challenging part of the race. Meanwhile, Quin put probably 20 minutes on me and blasted up the climb. Definitely lightheaded by the summit, I stumbled through the most gorgeous section of the course following the alpine ridges at the top of the resort until I reached the next aid where Quin was waiting for me. We descended together down to the cliff chair, and then onto the Rhonda lake trail where we encountered some serious mud, sometimes well past shin deep!

Since the course was run in three loops, with the last two sharing the descent, its here were we got passed by the guy in first place just coming down to finish from his final loop. Unfortunately for us, this meant that the volunteers also sent us down to the finish thinking that it was a tight race for the top 3 podium spots. So down we went, and after realizing the mistake once the finish area was in sight, sheepishly sidestepped the line and beelined it straight to the race director’s tent who got us sent back on course. Oh well, bonus miles! We opted to walk it back until we were on course before jogging again, which probably added 20-30 minutes in total. Back on course, we headed up through the village one last time and began the final climb, once more to the top of the resort. I was still feeling pretty weak through this second climb but luckily started finding a rhythm again once we began our final descent. Quin finally had a low point in the race (I was beginning to think this run was too easy for him) through the muddy section but toughed it out for the last few kms. Finally, less than 1km to go, we opened it up for a fun sprint finish to the line.

Our final time was 8:11, a little slower than my original goal of 7 hours but still respectable considering course conditions and that there was 2200M of climbing! Overall it was an amazing experience and I recommend everyone should try and do something that seems out of reach; I still don’t consider myself a runner. After a shower and a couple hours of relaxation my real test of endurance came after the race when I was faced with a 4-hour drive back to Vancouver to make it in time for work on Monday morning! Thanks to Quin and Matt for sharing the day with me, and for MEC/Bigwhite for hosting such a rad event!
