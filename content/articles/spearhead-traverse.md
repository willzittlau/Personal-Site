title: "Spearhead Traverse"
date: "2019-04-11"

Earlier this season I had the opportunity to complete the Spearhead Traverse with Nelson. This would both be our first ski traverse on the South Coast, and also technically my first ski traverse in general. I've done some hut trips and a few nights of winter camping but until this I hadn't combined them for a point to point overnight ski trip.Â 35 kms, 2500m ascent, and an uber classic, this was going to be a good introduction to skiing the Coastals.

Nelson works as a nurse at VGH, and I'm working a 9-5 at a mechanical engineering co-op currently so our schedules don't often line up. Unfortunately for him, he had the night shift the day before our start. We figured we could do the Spearhead over two days pretty easily even with a little fatigue and planned for this anyways. Nelson's shift ended at 7AM and I was at his place by 8AM. With a two hour commute this meant we weren't in Whistler until a few minutes past 10AM. Do the math, that's not a lot of sleep prior to a big traverse! Regardless, we were in Whistler, and were psyched. After figuring out parking (Lot 4 has designated spots for overnighters in Garibaldi) we went to guest services to pick up our backcountry lift ticket, an eye watering $70 single ride to the top of Whistler or Blackcomb mountain depending on the objective. Thanks Vail! After we got this sorted we continued onto the lifts and took our first ride up (neither of us had skied here yet either). Soon we were on the T bar and approaching the top of 7th heaven, and eventually after a short bootpack and traverse, the Blackcomb backcountry gate. We got prepped and started our watches at around 11:30AM and, as I weighted my pole for the first turn out the gate, it collapsed.

Yes, literally 5 seconds into the traverse, I broke my pole. It didn't snap, but somehow the epoxy joining the flick lock mechanism to the upper shaft had failed and caused the lock to slip down the shaft. Luckily ski straps can fix literally any problem and soon I had a fixed length, 135cm pole for the rest of the journey.

With this minor crisis solved, we continued on our way, and after our first transition, skied off the backside of Blackcomb into some heavily skied out and windblown snow. This was actually a great way to quickly adjust to skiing with our heavy packs, as we had plenty more windblown aspects ahead of us to ski. Not long after another transition we were traversing the Decker Glacier. Prior to the trip I read that the Spearhead has something like 20+ transitions, so we were trying to save as much time during these as possible. After a quick climb it was time for another descent, this time down onto the Trorey Glacier. The snow was about 10cm to boot-top dust on crust which made for enjoyable skiing even with the heavy pack. Some more skinning took us across the Trorey, and under the first proposed hut site on Mt Pattison which should be up and running by winter 2020. A quick boot pack took us up from here and allowed access to the Tremor glacier, which we crossed and began our first long ascent up to the Tremor-Shudder col.

Just before the boot pack (up the wall on the left)

By now it was already late, about 4:30 PM as we gained the col. With only an hour of daylight left we contemplated trying to make a quick crossing of the Platform Glacier, which is were we had originally planned to camp, but the weather quickly decided it for us. Not long after the winds rapidly picked up, with visibility reducing at the same rate. We pulled out the shovels and started digging a tent platform into the low point of the col, working with a sense of urgency as the temperature started dropping as well. In about half an hour we had a relatively flat platform and did our best to stomp down the sugary snow. We pitched the tent, a TNF Assault 2, and Nelson crawled inside with all his gear and began setting up his side for the night. Meanwhile, I continued to dig and saw out blocks, attempting to make a wind block, as it had really picked up by now. Roughly another half hour passed and I had built up enough of a wall that the wind passed over the tent, and I was feeling rather frosty (see photo) so I joined Nelson in the tent. We didn't have a vestibule so this involved grabbing everything in the tent and piling it on top of Nelson so that I could have space to setup my side; he didn't seem to mind the extra insulation. After I had inflated my pad and somewhat organized my stuff, it was time to switch again and all the gear got piled onto me. And so it continued, taking turns getting organized while the other was buried under all the gear. Finally we had both changed, were in our sleeping bags, and had stuffed the majority of our things under our pads for some extra insulation.

5 layers, still cold

During this time we found out that Nelson's pad had a hole in it. After inflating, about 10 minutes later he would be lying on the snow again. Luckily I had brought my half Z lite so we put this under his torso and then stuffed ropes and layers everywhere else. Now, it was time for dinner. We opened the tent door to grab snow and were blasted with cold. Our first brew went to me for rehydrating some curry, and I also filled up my Nalgene to have a hot water bottle for the night. Unfortunately, I later realized that the cap hadn't been tightened all the way and had slowly seeped, soaking the torso of my sleeping bag. Luckily for the next brew the wind had died down a bit and we managed to setup the cannister stove outside for Nelson's meal. The tent had gotten rather humid from cooking but quickly cooled down again, and thus began our long night in the cold. Nelson had brought his zero degree bag, which was synthetic at least, and piled on the layers. I had brought my -7 but with the wet patch on the chest, I could rapidly feel cold seeping in. The forecast for the night had only been around -10C, but my zip-o-gage read -15 in the tent and with wind chill it felt much colder than that outside. And so time slowly passed, with neither of us sleeping and both of us shivering. Outside the storm raged, covering us in a thin layer of snow from the condensation of our breath on the tent walls which was then shaken down onto us. At around 2am Nelson cranked the stove up again to try and get some heat, which worked temporarily, and did this a few times throughout the rest of the morning. By 5AM I had fallen into a shallow slumber and managed to sleep until about 6:30.

The ordeals of the night weren't over yet though! As we prepared breakfast and began another round of brews, we discovered that we no longer had any gas left to melt snow as it had been used up the night before battling the wind outside and warming us during the night. This meant that for the next 25kms, we had about 2L between us. This also meant that I couldn't defrost my liners, which as an oversight hadn't slept with me inside my sleeping bag and were now bricks of ice. Also, I don't think Nelson achieved anything that resembled sleep, definitely being the colder of us two, which meant that he had now been awake for about 48 hours and had another long day ahead. Nevertheless, we improvised on breakfast and pulled on our icy outerwear and packed up. Fortunately the wind had died down to almost nothing and we timed our morning chores with the sunrise, which rapidly warmed us. This also gave us time to appreciate how beautiful our little bivy site was, and with a 360 degree view of sun kissed Coastals, I felt very fortunate to have shared this moment with them.

Soon after we were on our way across Platform Glacier, where the wind the night before had raked pretty much any snow off its surface which made for some interesting skin skiing, and also resulted in me faceplanting the glacier and breaking my sunglasses. This section went by quick however and we were underneath the next peak, Quiver, in no time. Here we got our most enjoyable descent thus far, a super mellow couple 100M wide open descent onto the Ripsaw Glacier (Look at Nelson's textbook spread eagle mid run). During this descent we caught up with another group who had camped on the glacier the night before. After the next transition, we were onto the first roadblock of the traverse, where we met another group again. This season has been a really low snow year and the col between Ripsaw and Naden was bony, and required a quick 30 foot section of downclimbing, where I was happy to have my ice axe. After this travel was fast again for a while until we reached the next ridge, which offered the first bit of exposure on the route. After this we traversed onto Lago glacier and began the long climb up. At the top we broke for a quick lunch and continued on our way.

Travelling through the Coastals requires a scale adjustment, as the glaciers stretch on for kms and what looks like it's just across the valley could very well be a half day ordeal to get to. Such was the case on Lago, which felt like the climb was never ending. It was worth it though, as it also offered up the most enjoyable skiing on the route! The majority of pitches prior had been low angle or traversing, this one was straight down, 30 degrees and wide open. Regrouping on the Diavolo Glacier, we consulted our map and began our way across. In front of us was another 300m climb up the far end to get to the Fitsimmons-Benvolio col, however by now it was about 1PM and the slope was getting baked. I wasn't stoked on skinning it as I know our exposure time would be long with our packs, but we didn't really have any other options being at the back end of the traverse. Luckily, there was faint remnants of an old skin track, and careful steps allowed us to stay on packed down snow for the majority of the climb. At the top we got overtaken by one of the previous groups as we stopped and drank the last of our water.

Traversing under Benvolio ended up having the biggest objective hazard on the route, with a 30 foot cornice hanging over the traverse, and lots of evidence of it breaking off with refrigerator blocks of ice strewn about the glacier. We traversed this section one at a time without issue, and were on our way. Next, we reached Overlord and made our way around it for another descent. The entrance was sporty with a lack of snow, but quickly opened up into another awesome glacier run. We were now on our last glacier (Overlord) and only had one more climb before the looooong descent back into Whistler. One of the parties behind us was kind and gave us a fuel cannister during our transition, so we happily took an extra few minutes and brewed up some much needed water (we were both pretty dehydrated by this point). Up and over Whirlwind pass we went, the last climb! Nelson fell behind a bit on this point, which isn't surprising considering his lack of sleep. I waited for him at the top and we transitioned one more time for the descent to Russet Lake, another long wide open run. The skins went on one last time, and we climbed up and checked out the new Kees and Claire Hut. I have to say, I'm really glad that I had to do this traverse before the huts are operating as I do think it will change the nature of the traverse, it really does feel remote. However, I'm also really excited to do it again with the huts, and I think it's for the better that they're getting installed considering how much popularity the route already has.

Last climb up Whirlwind Pass.. We started on the far left across the valley the day before

Finally, we ripped the skins for the last time and started down into Singing Pass. Here we spilt up as I pushed hard and skied the entirety of Singing Pass in one go, something like 12km of skintrack/ski out/luge from hell with the packs. My quads were protesting and some of the sections got pretty loose (I didn't see the sign and caution corner was 0.005 seconds away from claiming my life), but I managed to get down in one piece about 50 minutes later. Skiing out onto the lower groomer and right into the heart of Whistler Village was a bit of a culture shock after being in such a remote feeling area, but definitely a welcome sight. It was still before 5 PM and we had completed the traverse in about 29 hours total, with 12 of those spent in the tent. I layered up and waited for Nelson to come down, which he did about half an hour later, looking pretty haggard. We walked back to the truck stoked and celebrated with some Whistler Brewing chestnut ale, fitting, and also my favourite seasonal brew. One pit stop on the way home included a burrito at Mag's 99 in Squamish, and before we knew it we were back in Vancouver. I dropped off Nelson at his place and rushed home, ready for some much needed rest before the work week ahead. I strongly recommend this traverse for anyone in the Whistler area, it's something special.
