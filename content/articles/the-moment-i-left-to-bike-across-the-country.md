I finished packing the truck, running on autopilot while my mind raced confirming that I would have everything I needed. As I loaded my bike and all of it’s bags I mentally checked off each item it contained. First, the bike itself. Check. Next, the panniers.

These were two big 20L, waterproof and durable roll top style bags from Ortleib and would be my main storage points. Inside the first one were all of my clothes that would need to face every form of weather I encountered, and when you're biking across a country like Canada, you expect to see it all. The second had everything else, my camp supplies, electronics, toiletries and miscellaneous items. In between these two bags I strapped my tent and a travel sized foam roller, an item I was quite proud of being able to fit into my packing list. I was extra nervous about overuse as I was just coming off of a hamstring injury and so something to aid in stretching was a non-negotiable for me.

At the front of the bike now, I cinched my down sleeping bag and camp pillow into a small waterproof stuff sack between my handlebars. On one fork leg I strapped my Thermarest, and on the other, a 2L Nalgene bottle. My downtube held a small peanut butter jar containing my repair kit and two more water bottles. Finally, I had two top tube bags to provide easy access to supplies while I was on the bike. A half-height frame pack held my bike locks and more easy access storage. Yep, it was all there and I was ready to go. My home on wheels for the next two months. I tried convincing myself that this was just going to be an extended camping trip, but unlike a weekend getaway, I knew that I would be a different person coming out of it.

I gave my mom a long hug goodbye and said a quick but earnest “I love you before” jumping in the driver's seat and turning the ignition. The truck rumbled to life and I had the next four hours to dwell in my thoughts. Too nervous to see the expression on her face, I didn’t look back as I pulled away. I knew that this trip had obvious risks and that she was well aware of them. When I go out on trips like this I think that she usually downplays her concerns, and to be fair I usually downplay the potential risks when explaining the details, but this time I knew it would be different. I would be alone for two months, on the highway with cars zipping by all day long. I didn’t know where I would be sleeping each night or how I was going to manage food and water. I figured I’d learn that on the fly when it came time.

Following the highway from the interior to the coast, I cruised on autopilot while my brain tried to process the reality that this trip was finally happening. I decided to save up my podcasts for later, knowing that my playlists were soon to become all too repetitive and these conversations would be an important reprieve. To be honest, I wouldn’t have been present for them anyways, the roar of my mind deafening as I attempted to prepare myself for the journey ahead. And so, music played faintly in the background while I filtered through my thoughts. So much had led up to this moment, and I was realizing that it hadn’t fully set in until now. It weighed over me like a ton of bricks.

Although on paper I checked all of the boxes, I felt pitifully unprepared. Hadn’t I always yearned for an adventure like this? I’d spent months preparing, years building the skills needed to pull off something like this, and yet there I was at the starting gates completely second guessing myself. Due to my injury in the fall I hadn’t even done a single bike ride of over 100km that year, and I was expecting to do that distance and more daily? What the fuck was I getting myself into?
