This was one of my unfinished posts way back from two summers ago! I finally just got around to finish writing about it. With that being said, lets get into it.

<b>Late July, 2017</b>

This time around the plan was to take my girlfriend on her first overnight backpacking trip. The objective was set at Kokanee Glacier Provincial park, at the the Kaslo Creek campground. Highlights include a bug-safe cooking hut, lakeside views from the tent, and the ever so popular Kokanee glacier hut just a short walk away housing the park ranger. All of these first-timer friendly amenities in the backcountry contributed to the choice, combined with a strong recommendation from friends who had gone the summer before. As with the theme of my summer, we left after I finished work around 6PM, squeezing the most out of my 2 day work weekend.

After piling our stuff into Ashleigh's SUV, we were off towards Kaslo. We stopped for dinner in Vernon and stopped again later that night for gas, and before we knew it our chances of making the Nakusp ferry diminished. We pulled up to the small ferry terminal well after hours and resigned ourselves to an early morning to make up driving time. Just as we were snuggling into our sleeping bags in the back of the SUV we were shocked to see the ferry steadily approaching us, realizing that the terminal is actually operational 24/7 but just runs by demand after hours. This small piece of knowledge would have saved us an argument earlier that evening about whether or not we had time to stop for food, but I'm glad it worked out for us anyways. The ferry was very ghost like with no operator in sight, although he was obviously housed inside the captains tower behind the dark midnight glass.

After the short 15 minutes ride was over we kept towards Nakusp, and soon after continued our way on to New Denver. We eventually made it to Kaslo well after 12am, (another theme of my summer adventures) and curled up in the back of the vehicle. Neither of us had questioned car camping in her Tribute, but it would've been wise to give it a try before committing to it because we soon found out neither of us fit comfortably behind the seats with about 4 feet of room for us to cram into. Regardless, we managed to get a short few hours of sleep rising at around 5AM without waking up too sore. (As a bonus, Ashleigh didn't even complain about our early wakeup, much preferring napping in the leather front seats over the uneven surface in the back)

After another stop at the full service gas station (small town BC!) we followed our Google maps directions up an old FSR.... And soon found ourselves crossing some of the most treacherous road conditions that I've seen. I'm not sure how often maps directions get updated or if Google was just trying to kill us, (right after I just bought into their new Pixel phone too) but either way after pushing aside fallen trees and crossing over a very questionable washout making the road just barely wider than our vehicle, we found our path blocked by a mudslide. Ashleigh was relieved to turn around and although I was frustrated, I was eager to get off of that road too, so we retraced our steps.

A quick trip back into Kalso for some reconnaissance uncovered that a) the road we were on had been decommissioned and b) we now had to drive towards Nelson for the next closest entrance. We'd only been set back by about an hour and still had plenty of time left after our unplanned early start.

Eventually we made it to the proper entrance, and were greeted by multiple Kokanee Glacier signs - a welcome sight. The last few kms of road definitely got a lot more choppy but as long as you have good clearance a 4x4 isn't necessary. From here we wrapped the car in chicken wire, as the porcupines are known to try and chew on brake lines and other cables under your vehicle. (A stereotypical Canadian problem to have, I know). And finally, we were ready for the trail!

The trail starts off really mellow on some double track slowly heading upwards, but quickly steepens. I wouldn't call it a steep hike, but it's sustained right up to the first lake. Right away Ashleigh was having trouble with her boots, and little did we know how bad it was going to get. Since this was going to be her first overnight in the backcountry she had gone out and bought some new gear the day before, and had unknowingly broken one of the fundamental rules: Don't get new footwear right before a long hike. I didn't realize she had gone out and bought new boots, and was expecting her to just use her GTX trail running shoes for the hike. Those shiny new boots were already doing a number on her feet. By 2km in she had already had blisters, which is a small feat in itself. We stopped to treat and tape up, but they continued to get worse and worse. By 5km she was cursing with every step but still wanted to keep pushing on through the gorgeous landscape.

Finally, the trail started trending downwards towards a very cold looking Kaslo lake (still filled with mini icebergs, in late July) where we stopped for lunch. Lunch seemed to lift Ashleigh spirits and we took off at a slightly quicker pace after once again treating her heels. Soon enough we walked the length of the lake via a loose trail across a boulder and scree field (which Ashleigh wasn't a fan of) down into a flat meadow.

By now Ashleigh really wasn't having a good time but I convinced her to push on. You climb a little bit and then head through the forest past two more small lakes until you finally arrive at the crossroads for the campground, turn left and you're there! Ashleigh hobbled into the cooking shelter and gingerly took off her boots while I hiked down to setup camp. For the rest of the evening we just hung out in the shelter relaxing, and I managed to get through the majority of Kilian Jornet's "Run or Die" (a really great book by the way). Dinner that night was as gourmet as it gets (not) - Mac N Cheese. It was a good meal to test out the simmer setting on my new stove, and I was pleased to find no burnt on mushy noodles after cooking. We left our bug free haven in the cooking cabin and climbed into the tent, settling into a peaceful sleep.

The next morning we woke up after a great nights sleep and made a quick breakfast. Weekend trips are always a little sad because they end way too soon, but that's the realities of two day weekends I guess. Ashleigh was expecting to go back to war with her feet that morning, and we did the best we could to apply tape and moleskin before heading out. The first km of trail heading back still had snow, and both our boots were quickly soaked. By the time we were nearing the scree field from the day before, Ashleigh was in so much pain that I finally offered to trade boots. I'm a size 42 and she's a 40 but I managed to squeeze my feet. I've worn tight climbing shoes, but these were on another level.

Through the next couple kms, we toughed it out until past the lake on the long descent where my toes felt like they were going to explode from all the pressure on them from walking downhill in the too small boots. Instead of endure the torture of putting them back on, Ashleigh opted to walk the last descent barefoot, which earned some confused looks from hikers heading up the trail. Not too long later, we  were back at the car. I don't think I've seen Ashleigh so excited as she grabbed her flip flops from the car, absolutely beaming. I drove us home on a rather uneventful journey, reminiscing about the trip, and we were back in Kelowna before dark.
