Yesterday after work I ran my first Half Marathon. I picked up running early last spring and have slowly added on the distance, averaging a 10km trail run + a shorter distance hill climb every week. Until yesterday, I hadn't run further than 15km in one take.  The decision to run this distance was partially because Strava was hosting the Great 13.1 Record attempt (Most amount of 13.1 miles aka half marathon distances ran in a day by the global community), as well as that I figured it would be a good goal to judge my progress by. I'm fortunate enough to live right behind Rose Valley Regional Park, so the loop was to be around the reservoir and then another half loop up and back via the road. I got off work at 5 and rushed back home, not having much spare time with the sunset just before 8PM. Here I met Quin and Carter who were also going to attempt the distance with me. We'd packed our bags the night before, and I'd loaded up my Sense vest with 1.5L of water along with a multitude of gels and snacks, a first aid kit, a windbreaker, and a headlamp.

By 5:30 we were off and climbing the first hill. Right from the start you ascend a significant amount of elevation, just over 200m gain in 1.6km. You top out by a old weathered tree, and then drop back into the valley. After a few kms of steady descent you gain the next hill, another 150m or so of vertical via steep switchbacks. At the top of this we took our first quick break and refuelled. The next rolling kms take you on the back edge of the cliffs along the front side of the reservoir on an XC trail called Barebones. The trail spits you out on the reservoir access road which starts from the yellow gates at the bottom end of the park, this is the 1/3 mark. You run up the road for about half a km and then head left onto the MTB climbing trail, Daze of Roses,. Follow the switchbacks up for another 150m of elevation until they intersect with a trail called Lake Loop. As the name suggests, this trail will take you around the lake for the next 5kms. This is where we took our second break. Follow the Lake Loop trail along the edge of the reservoir and eventually through the forest at the far end of the lake. Unfortunately, around the 12km mark I got stung by a hornet just as we were leaving the forest. After you round the far end of the reservoir is the hardest part of the route. Turn left off of the Lake Loop onto a very direct hill which climbs you about 250m up. Eventually it flattens out and heads left, you'll skirt along the edge of a small pond. Keep following the trail until it eventually spits you out onto a series of long benches, which will join back to the original climbing trail.

This is where Carter had to leave just past the 2/3 mark due to cramping issues and dizziness, but put up an incredible effort considering this was only his 3rd trail run this year and we had already gained 750m elevation at this point. We had now completed a full loop of the reservoir and only had 6km to go. Once again we grunted up the starting hill, dipped into the valley and began our climb up the next test piece. Quin dusted me up the hill at full pace, and hit a HR above 190! I don't know how he managed to sustain that after how long we had been running, but I felt like I was redlining just at a slow jog up the last few steps. We topped out just as the sunset was waning, and donned our headlamps. I breathed a silent thank you as we started our descent down the front side of the park, all the strenuous climbs behind us. I could definitely feel the fatigue now, but gravity helped pull us downwards until we finally exited the park by the school entrance. The last 2km back were on the road, and I felt a burst of energy as our endpoint became closer and closer. Finally we turned off onto my street and I dug deep as I climbed up the road for the last 500m of my run.

Sprinting down to my doorstep, muscles screaming, I ended Strava and impatiently waited to see the result. 21.3km, 2:48 total trip time, with a moving time of 2 hours, 31 minutes, 10 seconds, 975m of total elevation gain, and an average moving pace of 7:05/km. To be honest it irks me a bit that I didn't quite break the 1000m threshold, but still I'm pretty damn happy with how I felt and the time considering it was after a full work day and close to 1km of vertical climbing! I really recommend going out and trying to run this distance if it's been a goal of yours, as you might find it's a lot more obtainable than you think!
