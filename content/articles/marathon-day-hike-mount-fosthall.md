On this trip we decided to take a break from climbing, and instead made plans on an overnight trip to Monashee Provincial Park, just outside of Cherryville BC. Once again after a workday we headed out – although this time we weren’t on the road until 10PM after Quin got off work. The drive was uneventful but seemed to drag on in the dark. We finally pulled off to the side about 5kms outside of the park boundary and set up camp well after midnight.

It seemed like I had just fallen asleep when I was awoken by itching all along my side where my sleeping bag was unzipped. I re adjusted and it went away but soon enough I was itchy all over again where my body was exposed from the bag. I reached for my headlamp and dreaded what I saw. It’s here that I’ll take a dramatic pause and explain what I’d been using as my solo sleep set up for the summer. I had ordered the Sea2Summit Nano Mosquito Pyramid earlier and cut out a Tyvek bathtub floor to pair with it since it’s a floorless shelter. Then, I added adhesive Velcro to the floor and corners/sides of the bug netting so that I could pitch them together quickly and not worry about a side becoming unfolded. Paired with a Siltarp 2, I had a weather+bug proof shelter that weighed in under 2lbs with tie outs and stakes.

My mistake was that in my hurry to get more than 5 hours of sleep I had staked the sides out too tight and had put a small tear in the netting down by my legs. Coincidentally, how my tarp was pitched was funneling bugs towards that end of the shelter, and more than a few had found their way in. When my headlamp illuminated the small space, I was greeted with the sight of dozens of no-see-ums crawling along my exposed side with many more of them caked along the inner walls of the net. I quickly shimmied out of the shelter and dragged my sleeping bag with me back to the truck, popped the seat back and settled down in defeat, my goals of getting a good sleep crushed. I woke up at around 4am and was met shortly after by Quin who had also been menaced by the buzzing of mosquitos all night long, although protected a tad more successfully with his hexamid. As we made our coffee and oatmeal we were bombarded, and even without more than a few inches of skin showing we were both perpetually followed by our own personal swarms.

Our goal was to hike up to Mt Fosthall, 2686m tall and about 20km away from the trailhead, and then spend the night down at Big Peters Lake. By around 5am we were already off, finally escaping the bugs. The hike begins mellow along a forest trail until it slowly ascends up towards Spectrum Lake (6km). The next campground is 5kms further at Little Peters Lake, but ascends about 800m up from Spectrum lake. It’s an unrelenting climb, and travels through a very overgrown trail over rocky terrain. Eventually, the trail returns to dirt and slowly flattens out again until you reach the lake. Just after the hills, I was lucky enough to get blisters which plagued me for the rest of the day. I have to say the view from camp at Little Peters is gorgeous and I actually preferred it over Big Peters, although I suspect the bugs would be even worse at this site. From Little Peters to Big Peters is another 4ish kms, with only about another 100m of elevation. We made blistering time, and ended up at Big Peters in just a little over 4 hours from the trailhead. After a casual “lunch” break and some rest we continued on our way up the valley.

Shortly past camp we met the snow line and trudged our way onwards. Neither of us had thought to really consult any beta, and both just figured Fosthall would be the prominent peak at the end of the valley, via a straightforward approach. This assumption, although not incorrect, was a mistake. The end of the valley ascends sharply, and as we postholed our way up we saw what we thought was the ridge of Fosthall above us. As we crested the end of the valley, there was a trail that headed out left and over into the next basin. TAKE THIS TRAIL! Foolishly, we decided on the direct route in front of us and assumed that the other trail took you around the backside of Fosthall. We filled our bottles in a waterfall, and from here on the hiking got steep, real steep.

Unfortunately, I don’t have any photos of this part as is the case when you’re enjoying some quality type 2 fun; but after gaining about 500m of elevation up shale in the last 2 kms we finally made the ridgeline... And saw Fosthall as the distant summit at the end of the ridge system. Also, we could see the trail which we chose to ignore draw a path through the valley below us and head out towards the base of Fosthall. Optimistically we hoped that by continuing along the ridge that it would eventually descend back down and connect with our intended peak. We were wrong.

Not only was the ridge just a giant pile of choss, but as we continued along the width of it got thinner and thinner and we were soon finding ourselves scrambling along 4th class terrain. The exposure wasn’t nearly as bad as Tupper, but holds would flake off effortlessly and crumble to the valley below as we gingerly made progress. We continued scrambling until we gained the highpoint on the ridge, at which point we saw that our line ended a couple hundred metres short of our goal. We decided it wasn’t worth it, and knew that we weren’t going to have the time or energy to backtrack down into the next valley and regain all of the vert to summit Fosthall. It had already been 20.5kms, and over 2000m of vert to get to this point. Just below the highpoint on the ridge we found a nice perch and enjoyed our second lunch and snapped some photos.

The descent proved to be just as trying as the ascent. We didn’t really like the prospect of more exposed scrambling down to our original path up, and instead dropped into a scree chute as soon as we found one that was a reasonable angle. After sliding our way down, we were back on snow. It had warmed up and every other step had us sinking deep. Luckily most of the way was all downhill and a majority of the rocks hadn’t melted through yet, so we butt slid our way down most of the way. It was here that Quin shattered one of his poles while tripping up during a power slide, and by the end of it we were both fully soaked. We took another break and wringed out our socks, and I tended to my blisters which had burst on both heels. A quick jaunt back through the woods had us returning to Big Peters.

After a quick chat, we both realized that neither of us were as worn out from the day so far as we were expecting, and were still running with lots of time. We decided we’d head back to Little Peters, and stop for dinner and see how we felt there. I didn’t voice it to Quin, but secretly I was very motivated on a one-day push because of the prospect of spending another bug filled night in my shelter with no escape. We chilled out at Little Peters and cooked ramen while chatting with two girls who had also made the hike up that day sometime after us. With a proper rest I was feeling good, and we still had a ton of daylight left.

We began the long descent back down to Spectrum lake, a spot where we had both briefly discussed setting up camp again, but I think we both knew that if we made it that far we were just going to finish the day in one push. After a knee knackering descent with tired legs we hobbled past the Spectrum lake trail sign. In the forest it was starting to get dark, even though it was only about 7PM. Giving it all into a final push and not wanting to rely on headlamps, we picked up the pace. The ending of our trip was very similar to Tupper, and as we passed the last 2km sign we both broke out into a jog, and then into an all our run as the last few turns flew by under our feet. Fully sprinting to the truck, I let out a cry of joy but immediately began to pull of my boots as the burning pain on my heels started to drown out the adrenaline.

Although our trip was technically unsuccessful, it was still a long day of exciting type 2 fun in the mountains. We hadn’t summitted Fosthall, and we hadn’t quite hit the 42km distance of a proper marathon, but we had still managed to complete 41+ kms of hiking over mountainous terrain, unexpected and loose chossy scrambling, as well as doubled our original hiking goal all in under 15 hours truck to truck, and I wouldn’t have it any other way. My socks were bloody and feet exhausted after carrying me so far and being submerged in the snow for 6+ hours, but all the exhaustion in our bodies couldn’t wipe the grins off our faces. After drinking every drop of liquid we had left stashed in the truck (Gatorade, beer, day old tea??) and snacking on the remainder of our provisions, we continued on our way home. Once again I battled sleep the whole drive home, (a trend I really need to stop) and was relieved as I finally pulled down my driveway.

**Lessons learned from this trip:**

- Bring a tent repair kit & don’t pitch it as tight if you want to guarantee a peaceful, bug free sleep
- Treat blisters early on and not after your feet are soaked and already raw
- Don’t catch your carbon pole on a rock while running/sliding down snow (it will explode)
- Consult route beta before leaving, and follow the obvious trail unless you want to end up scrambling along a chossy ridge somewhere like us
