This week I was lucky enough to get my hands on the new Diverge. For the last while I've been toying with the idea of getting a proper road bike for commuting (this summer I've been using an old vintage 10 speed frame), as well as for longer adventure rides; really just a bike that I can take anywhere and handle any condition, while having fun. When the new Diverge was released I knew it was the bike I was looking for. Fortunately, I work at a LBS and was able to put one on order as soon as the dealer site was updated. I opted to go for the carbon sport model, which sports the Fact 9r carbon frame and fork, Tiagra groupo, Praxis Works Alba sub-compact crankset and the mechanical Tektro Spyre disc brakes. It retails for $2919 CAD.  I also bought some of the Burra Burra bags from their new bikepacking lineup, a set of 32c Roubiax road tires for commuting in the summer, upgraded to the carbon CGR post or "cobble gobbler" to even out the compliance font and rear, and swapped out for a carbon railed Toupé Pro saddle that we had lying in our demo bin. For those of you who already know the bike's unique features, scroll on downwards. For those who haven't heard about the new Diverge yet, I'll run you through the basics below:

**Future Shock** - Specialized first employed this on their new Roubaix lineup. It is a suspension headset that offers 20mm of front travel via an internal spring. If you want to read all about the nitty gritty and it's claimed benefits, go to the big S's site and read all about it. In use it definitely takes the harshness out of bumps, offering a smooth ride and its travel is only really noticeable if hammering out of the saddle, but even then the gentle sway of the bars feels quite natural. One interesting point is that the Roubaix uses a linear spring, while the new Diverge has one with progressive travel which is said to be better for off road applications.

**Clearance** - The new Diverge boasts a wide clearance of up to 42mm on the carbon models, which pairs nicely with their newly released Sawtooth 700x42c adventure tire. 42c not enough? Drop down to a 650b wheelset and the bikes will now take up to 47mm tires! The aluminum framed models shrink in clearance a little bit, and will fit a 38mm tire at max. I suppose specialized figures the sweet spot is at 38mm, as all carbon models ship with their 38c trigger tires as stock.

**Geometry** - Specialized has moved away from traditional cyclocross geo, and has instead built this bike up with their "Open Road" geometry, which they say "crushes both dirt and road with confidence, featuring a lower BB, slacker head tube, and shorter chainstays.". The result? A bike that feels very stable in a variety of terrain, yet still manages to feel quite snappy on the road. It's not a super light and nimble race bike, but I feel as if it'll hold its own on longer rides and will come into it's element when the tarmac ends.

**Features** - The frame has 3 spots for water cages, 2 in the main triangle via bolts in sets of 3s, allowing you to mount on an anything cage or install the SWAT box specialized made for their new road frames under your bottle cages, as well as a set of bolts on underside of the downtube. All cables are internally routed, even a spot for the front brake cable through the fork, giving a very clean finish. Finally the bike has all sorts of rack and fender mounts, including a bolt on each fork for as well as eyelets by the front axles for front racks. If you want to run a pannier, you'll have to get an eyeleted seat clamp or similar but that's about the only add on necessary for complete rack heaven.

**Okay! back to the review:**
Some of you may wonder why I didn't just opt for the Diverge Comp, as I was already putting in some extra cash for the CGR post which comes stock on the Comp, and also has the benefit of a full groupo upgrade to 105 hydraulic, as well as a model up wheelset upgrade. First of all I'm not quite sold on hydraulics yet - on my mountain bike sure, that's a no brainer, but on a road bike designed for adventure I'd prefer the serviceability of good old mechanical. When hydraulic eventually trickles down in price I might upgrade then, but for now the TRP Spyres get the job done. Second, if you look at the cassettes on the two different models my trusty Tiagra 10 speed gives me a range of 11-34, which paired with the sub-compact 48/32 Alba crankset gives me a climbing gear ratio of 0.94. With 105, the cassette range drops to 11-32, resulting in a one-to-one ratio. Aesthetically I wasn't a huge fan of the navy blue that's found on the Comp, and although I do love the second colourway of white and red, sadly it wasn't available in Canada. I was more than happy to settle upon the gloss grey and black paint that I've ended up with on my Sport. Finally, the extra cash saved between the costs of the two funded all of the bike-packing bag add ons.

Its the little things that matter. My 56cm frame has clearance in the main triangle for the Burra Burra Framepack 5, as well as two Rib cages which can both hold a 23oz bottle. It's tight, but they all fit. Next off, I mounted the Burra Burra Stuffcage (Specialized's take on an anything cage) under the downtube via the two bolts. When bikepacking I was hoping I could use this to strap my siltarp 2 out of the way and free up space elsewhere.  At first glance it didn't look like it was going to work as I was expecting it to rub up against the chainrings, however once I strapped everything down the supplied compression straps actually bring it in enough that there is the perfect amount of clearance. Nice!

What I'm most excited about for this bike is it's versatility. Doing a road ride? slap on some narrower tires (ie those 32c Roubaix tires that pair so nicely) and pull off all of your frame bags. Same goes for if you want to do some cross riding, just pickup some knobbies and you're good to go. Commuting? Choose your tire and throw the framepack back on as well as any other bags you have. Bikepacking/Touring? Add on the stuffcage, handlebar harness and either get a stabilizer seat pack or eyeletted clamp and run a pannier on the back and you're off on your next pedal powered adventure. If you have the CGR post just make sure to swap out for an alloy post as neither an eyeletted clamp nor the new clamped seatpacks are meant for use with carbon posts. My setups are most likely going to be this:

A note on Speacialized's bikepacking bag lineup. These things are pretty sweet. Very weatherproof, made with a very durable face fabric. However, every piece is also very overbuilt. The weights on these things aren't impressive, and most of the straps are annoying long. The upside is that I do expect these to last a lifetime, and every piece adds tons of useful storage to the bike. They might not be as good as the lighter weight options in the niche market of bikepacking, but its cool that Specialized realized it's a growing market and piggybacked off of existing ideas  to make a very solid first lineup. It'll be interesting to see what future generations of the Burra Burra bags bring.

I seriously  can't wait to test out this bike for a variety of different uses. I really do think it's as close as you can come to a one bike quiver for the road/gravel, (as long as you aren't racing) and it'll be interesting to see if it has any limitations. Only having logged a few quick rides so far, it's hard to really give an in-depth review on the ride characteristics, but what I can say is that those rides have been a blast. For my first dive into the world of road biking, I really do think I just found myself a lifetime frame and something I will continue to reach for whenever I want to go out on a new unknown road or my longer rides. I've also been dreaming up some bigger goals with this bike, and I'm excited to share them once they come together. See you out on the roads!
