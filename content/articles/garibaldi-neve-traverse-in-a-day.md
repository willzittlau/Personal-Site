After an after work mission to Squamish for some climbing a couple weeks ago, Nelson and I made plans for another ski traverse. The next week came and our weather window looked good, and more importantly our days off of work aligned. With fresh beta from another friend having done it the previous weekend and lots of traffic on the route, we decided to go for the Garibaldi Neve, which is a point to point 40km ski traverse with ~2000m gain in Garibaldi Provincial Park, starting from the Diamond Head parking lot and exiting at the Rubble Creek trailhead. We agreed on a plan to attempt it in a day, a big goal for us both. Since neither of us had done the route, we both opted to pack bivy gear instead of only emergency equipment, as I suspect we both had the feeling that we had a high chance of getting nighted on the route.

I left Vancouver at 3:30 AM on Saturday morning and made the commute to Squamish, where I met Nelson at the 24 hour McDonalds. Here we grabbed breakfast and left one of the cars. The road up to the Diamond Head was filled with deep muddy ruts from the melt, and we rallied Nelsons Mazda 3 up, luckily only with a few scrapes. We casually geared up in the dark and were on the trailhead a few minutes before 6 AM.

We set a quick pace skinning by headlamp, arriving at Red Heather in about 50 minutes. From here we followed the marked wands of the winter route and were down at the Elfin Lakes hut in exactly 2 hours. We wanted to get through the next section before the sun warmed the slopes above, but by now the sun was up so we rushed into the hut and chugged water and slammed nutrition, our last resupply point until rubble creek at the far end of the traverse. We both filled 2.5L for the rest of the trek and were on our way in less than 10 minutes.

The next section of the traverse is through Ring Creek, which is arguably the only real complex terrain of the whole traverse, and a massive terrain trap. It was about 9am when we travelled through this section without incident, although there was evidence of natural activity on almost every slide path from days prior. We opted to ski the section across the slide paths, our first transition of the day. The skins went back on once we had crossed the creek, and we began the long gradual ascent up towards Opal Cone. This section honestly flew by and before we knew it we were standing on the Neve. The portion on the Neve itself is a lot shorter than I imagined and we were quickly across the bulk of it and climbing again parallel to the Tent, for the last big ascent of the day.

Here we decided to stop for lunch as I became quickly fatigued on the climb. Lots of sugar and a half litre of water remedied this and we began the climb... which never seemed to never end. By now it had been about 4 and a half hours and the sun was beating down, my zip-o-gage reading +15 in the alpine and I was feeling it. However, nothing lasts forever and we were eventually on top, with panoramic views of the park in every direction. The skins came off again and we began our first descent down towards the Sharkfin. Here there was a section of lightly crevassed terrain, but with tracks from previous parties we didn't decide to rope up, and skated around the features. This section also gives a lovely view of Mt Garibaldi's north face, another popular objective, where we saw at least 6 people running a train up the switchbacks on the face! I should mention that the Neve was also really busy, with us having passed 8 parties by this point. We harvested some spring corn below the Sharkfin and put the skins on one more time on the glacier below, reapplying skin wax now that the snow was rapidly heating up.

This marked our last climb of the route, an easy gradual ascent up to the col between the Glacier Pikes. Unfortunately for us this section had been wind hammered and hadn't seen as much sun as the previous slope, and we made a few cautious first turns from the top. These few turns took us around a corner and into a gulley, where I could see our exit point onto the lake far below and to the left. With a relatively straight shot down and uninspiring ski quality, I pointed the sticks straight. I don't think I've ever been so gripped on skis, my watch pinged me at >80km/hr but it felt waaaaaaay more loose than that with a touring pack and bulletproof windslab. Exiting the gulley, I made one wide 100m turn, probably the tightest radius I could manage, to point me straight down on to the lake.

On the flats I waited for Nelson to catch up and we skated onto the lake together, our time to this point being a little under 7 hours. My blisters quickly protested skate skiing so I put the skins on for another transition. Nelson kept skating ahead but eventually the extra effort and blisters also inspired him to transition to skins as well. I knew that the lake was long, but it really felt like we were on it forever even though it was only about an hour and a half. Midway across Nelson started bonking and we took it slow for the last half. I beat him by a few minutes and savoured the short time not moving with my pack off. Once he caught up we headed towards the final section, Rubble Creek. Our time to this point was now 8.5 hours.

We missed the entrance to the summer trail and followed the old skin track... which was rapidly melting out. After a few questionable snow bridge crossings we followed some old tracks which bushwhacked back up onto the hiker's trail. Not fast travel. Since neither of us knew this section I opted to skin ski heels locked and Nelson fully transitioned to ski mode. Ultimately we should have both tele'd this section and we lost time (and for me, probably some toenails) on this part. Finally the trail did start a steady descent, although the snow was really dirty and riddled with postholes from early season hikers. Once again we made the wrong call here and tele'd with skins on, when it would have been much more efficient to ski. (However, my bases thank me for it, coverage was very thin). At around the 4km point I opted to start bootpacking. I had chosen to bring a pair of trail runners along on the whole traverse, just for this section. Nelson on the other hand had decided that this was unnecessary weight and continued skiing until he physically ran out of snow. Our soft goal of sub 10 had come and passed, although when we set that we still didn't even know if we would be able to complete the whole thing in a day. Even so, we both set a good pace on the bootpack down. I inevitably caught up with Nelson at around the 1.5km marker. At the 1km marker our time was 10:48 and we pushed the pace going for sub 11. I have to commend my partner on the fact that he managed to do a 10 min/km pace walking downhill in ski boots with blistered feet, because my body was protesting enough even in trail shoes. Wrecked, we staggered out with just a minute to spare, successfully completing the traverse in 11 hours trailhead to trailhead. The trip wasn't over yet though!

My feet absolutely refused to go back into ski boots so I walked the few kms down to the highway while Nelson skied the patchy road down to the lower lot. Our next step was finding a ride back into Squamish, so I carefully crossed highway 99 and threw my thumb into the air. Fortunately, within about 20-30 minutes a kind lady in a CRV coming back from Whistler picked us up and dropped us back in Squamish. Back at the first car, we grabbed drinks at the McDonalds before heading back up to the lot. Our last crux of the journey was that the ground had warmed up during the day, causing the ruts to get deeper. I had a rental car for the weekend and it wasn't going up that road, and with Nelson's feet wrecked from the hike out in ski boots I was the designated courier. After hitching another ride to the upper parking, I looked around and saw that Nelson's Mazda had the least clearance in the lot by a good 3", but we were quickly running out of options and daylight. Picking a line, I bumped and scraped my way through back down without incident (thankfully he has skidplates!). Rendezvousing at the lower lot, we shared some more stoke and a fist bump and went our separate ways. Doing my best not to doze off on the Sea to Sky, I was back home by about 9:30 PM, 18 hours after I had left that morning.
