Last winter I was given a board to learn on from the shop, and picked up snowboarding riding nights at Grouse. By the end of season I was pretty hooked, and while looking at boards came across a steal on a G3 Scapegoat at their factory sale, where I also picked up a pair of skins as well. One of my good friends already hardboots, and personally having an ill purchased pair of too soft to ski skimo boots at home, I figured why not give hardbooting a go. Being an engineering student and just generally taking on personal projects that I don't have the time for, I thought why not just make them myself and save the $300 on Spark's (plus, since I'm graduating soon, its a nice project to add to the personal portfolio). The next few months had me patiently scouring marketplace and splitboard.com where the necessary items slowly fell into place. A set of pucks & hardware, a set of old voile plates & pins, a pair of burton raceplates, and a set of 1st gen dynafit TLT radicals. Eventually, I had all the items I needed. I sourced some 1/4" aluminum plates from scrap at work and made a template on CAD. Next was ordering the appropriate sized SS screws from the hardware store. Finally, it was time to start the fun part.

The process for making adaptors was pretty straightforward: cut the aluminum to size, drill at the right locations & tap threads. I replaced the ski screws for the dynafit toes with M5s, which are close. Once I had made both sets of toe & heel adaptors, I test fit them on the board with the dynafit toes and heel risers, and checked the spacing with my boot. So far, so good. One thing that I would like to do in the future is cut off excess material but for now, they work fine.

The next step was the most stressful part, making the bindings. After measuring the bolt spacing of the boots while in the burton raceplates, I put the voile plates on the board, put the boots on the plates, and tried to get them as centered as possible. Then I marked the centerline on the plates, and transferred the raceplate hole spacing onto the plates via sharpie, with a -2mm tolerance to make sure the bails would fit tight. Next I drilled and dremmelled the existing hole pattern out on the plates up to the marks I had made. I 3D printed out a set of canting shims since I hadn't managed to source a pair of canted pucks, and stacked these on top of the plates. For these I printed a set of flat, 2.5, and 4 degree shims to experiments with. Right now I'm riding 2.5 degree front and back. I dremmelled out the rivets holding the raceplates together, and then transferred the bails onto the cants and bolted the whole sandwich down into the stock voile T nuts. Luckily everything fit together quite nicely when I set everything up on the board.

The boots I am using are a pair of old PDGs, which were a whole project in themselves. When I bought them it turns out the rivets in the pivot had ovalled themselves out so I had to do a full pivot rebuild using my own bushing & T nut system which I had designed the season before while trying to get them skiable. This project, although successful, ultimately ended up in me giving up due to how soft the boots still were. Other than this, they just required a ton of delicate punching to properly fit my toebox without any pressure points (working at a ski shop really came in handy for this part). I added a ski strap powerstrap to add some elasticity, and swapped out the paper thin dynafit liner for an intuition protour. This boot is almost identical to the TLT6 (just with a carbon cuff & thinner shell plastic), which has been a favourite hardboot for many, so the next couple mods that I've yet to do are the forward lean mod & moving the instep buckles to the pivots.

With no project timeline or deadline, I eventually finished up everything in early summer. I took the board and bindings out for their maiden voyage on a solo trip to Baker and skied an ocean of suncups, but had a blast. Now I've gotten just over 5 days on the bindings now in a variety of terrain and conditions and they're still feeling bomber, but definitely still in test phase. Overall I'm really stoked on how well everything's working, especially because I'm still primarily a skier so this was a nice cheap way to access another sport on those mellow days with friends.

All together, I ended up paying less in total than retail for just the board alone on what would cost over $2500 if you bought everything new. Not as shiny or lightweight as brand new gear from the factory, but nothing can match the feeling of riding your own homemade gear when it works just as well. If anyone wants to make their own adaptor plates, here's PDFs of my templates below. If you have any other questions about the process and are trying to make your own bindings, don't hesitate to shoot me a message as well.
