It was spring, I was freshly graduated, and the pandemic had completely changed daily life. I had been getting back in shape with all of my free-time, and with races getting cancelled left and right, it was time to look at some personal goals that I had set. Growing up in the Okanagan, one ride that had always stood out to me was riding around the lake. Taking the KVR to Penticton is a popular ride, and so is the Westside Road - Vernon - railtrail loop. Although I had yet to do any of the above, putting them together into one mega day seemed quite appealing. And so, the training began. 

The first big ride of the year was up to bigwhite and back for some late spring skiing with Carter, 145k + 2600m of elevation (Read about that ride [here](https://willzittlau.com/blog/bike-to-ski)). Next I figured it was time to get some beta for the route. I rode 90km of the KVR to Penticton portion with Quin, and we got absolutely sandbagged trying to take Chute Lake Rd up from Kelowna to the KVR. Although maps says it' a main road, there was a lot of walking and there's no way my truck would've made it through. Although it sucked at the time it was good to know that Gillard would be the road I'd want to take for the long ride. After blasting down the KVR we arrived in Penticton and carried onto Skaha where we met up with Carter and Scott for some late afternoon climbing, as they had generously offered to drive us back. I was absolutely blasted from the ride, but managed to crawl my way up a couple routes at least. The next ride was a nice and flat 100km loop in town with Noah for his first century ride. We were smart enough to do this ride at 2pm on one of the first 30 degree days of the summer so it was nice getting some heat tolerance back. Following this I joined up with Scott to get some exposure to the Westside Road - Vernon half of the loop, which also ended up being Scott's first century. This section is 140km, with the first half being all road to Vernon and then all gravel back to Kelowna when you link onto the freshly completed railtrail. Supplementing these rides with 30-50km weeknight rides and the time had come. The only section I hadn't ridden yet was Penticton back to West Kelowna, and I had some beta from a friend who had just finished the ride a couple weeks prior.

After Canada Day temps were finally dropping back down with some rain in the forecast. I tentatively set the day for July 9th and let some friends know. The morning rolled around and I was out the door early to meet Craig, Scott and Quin downtown for a 6am depart. They had generously offered to join for the first half of the ride. I had decided to get the hardest part of the ride over with first and run it clockwise, heading to Penticton first. And so we headed up lakeshore, getting a nice easy warm up before having to start the abrupt climb up from the lake. Gillard to the KVR is about 800m and 11k if I remember, and pretty much on the entire time. 32/34 gearing made it manageable to pedal the whole way. After getting murdered by bugs at the KVR entrance for a couple minutes waiting for the friends to catch up we continued on our way, hoping we could make up some time on the flat trail ahead. 

Unfortunately that was to much to ask for. The KVR since I had last ridden it was in way worse shape, the rain had filled in all the potholes and an awesome mixture of sand and mud was working its way through our drivetrains, along with mandatory shin deep puddle crossings. We battled this section for a while, Craig got a flat, it started raining, and overall moral was deteriorating a bit. I made the tough decision to drop my friends at Chute Lk Lodge to hopefully make up some time and bid them farewell. It was cold, and I was putting some extra pressure on myself to catchup after the slower start to the day so I hammered on.

With numb hands I careened down towards Naramata, getting jolted around and overall just staying completely gripped for the next hour. On the last ride this section had been smooth gravel, now it looked like someone had torn down it in side by sides or dragged a trailer with the brakes locked up, as it was completely torn up. Still, I managed to average around 35k/h as I rolled through Naramata. Not long after I was in Penticton where some route-finding began as this was the section I had yet to ride. About 100k in, 70k being rough gravel, I was looking forward to some road miles to get some feeling back in the arms.

But before that I still had to finish the rail trail between Penticton and Summerland. I had expected it to be similar to the railtrail that runs from kelowna, which is awesome tightly packed crush gravel, but unfortunately I was in for an unwelcome suprise. This section ended up being the worst on the ride, literally turning into a sandy, rocky quad track almost right away. Luckily it's a short segment but it took a lot out of me. In summerland, I realized that at this point being 7+ hours in I had only drank about 500mL of water. I hadn't been thinking about nutrition as I should have been and started bonking hard on the highway towards Peachland.

Luckily there's a great fruit stand right before entering Peachland, and I restocked heavily here. A sausage roll, samosa, two full Gatorades and a cookie later I was back on the road. Peachland flew by and before I knew it I was climbing up drought hill. When driving it the hill seems big and the shoulder seems small so I had been a bit concerned for this bit, but on a bike it was actually way more comfortable than I thought and only took about 15 minutes to finish.  Back to familiar roads, I headed down Gellatly to Boucherie road and dipped down into Kalmoir to shortcut back to the bridge.

Back at the overpass above the bridge, now 145k in, I met my mom who had set up a makeshift aid station in the back of the car. I mucked an entire family pack of sushi rolls, a banana, drank at least 3L of water and had a quick 10 minute nap. Feeling very re-vitalized I continued onto westside road. It started raining and didn't stop until I was well into Vernon.  I really put my head down on the west-side road loop, starting to feel the miles but suffering through it. A highlight of this segment is the hill coming down Fintry, you can easily top 80k/h without pedaling, a nice treat after what feels like endless climbing to get there. I remember looking at my watch and thinking 'Oh yay, I only have about 4 hours to go' which is funny because usually a 4 hour ride feels long in itself.

Reaching the 'Welcome to Vernon' sign, I had a deep sense of satisfaction and I knew the ride was in the bag, the next 60k are almost dead flat and off of the highway on the rail trail. It was getting late and my muscles were really starting to protest, so I hammered on with almost no breaks. The closer and closer I got, the harder and harder I started pushing it. I remember being shocked that I was holding 30+km/h on the last gravel stretch as this was faster than I usually can go on that section, and I was 14 hours deep into my ride. It's funny, I was hoping to find my limit on this ride but I still have more to go apparently. Rolling by UBCO, it was getting dark so I pushed it a little more. Before I knew it, I was back downtown and could see the sails ahead of me. As with most endurance fests, it felt a bit surreal stepping off of my bike and back into reality, looking around seeing people out for dinner and casually walking around downtown. 

I had ridden 280km in 15 hours, with about 130 of that being gravel. My hands were numb, and alarmingly stayed that way for a couple days. I've never had worse saddle sores, and can't wait to do it again! I've already been looking at other options, and I'm pretty sure it would be possible to link up an almost 100% gravel ride on the same loop.  You could also comfortably do this ride as a two day and probably make it way more enjoyable, but sometimes it's fun to push yourself.
