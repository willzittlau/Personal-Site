One monday near the end of June after work one of my best mates Quin and I piled into the truck and hurriedly loaded our gear. We were making the most of our two days off  of work, trying to make the Stawamus Chief campsite which closes at 11PM. Getting off at six didn't leave much time for the 450km journey from Kelowna. After making the tactical decision of skipping a drive-through dinner, we managed to arrive at the gates around 10:55PM. For those who don't know, Squamish is a seaport town located along the Sea to Sky Highway between Vancouver and Whistler, and is marked by the giant granite monolith towering above the city known as Stawamus Chief. Squamish should be a destination on any climbers list, offering an abundance of beginner friendly to extremely difficult trad and sport routes scattered upon the chief aswell as the granite walls surrounding the city. As we pulled into one of the last camping spots, we cracked open some beers and gazed at the large dark shadow of granite blotting out the stars, rising up from the trees before us.

The next morning we discussed our plan of attack while boiling up coffee and oatmeal on the tailgate of my truck. After breakfast we arrived at the smoke bluffs, a series of pleasant crags overlooking the city below. The smoke bluffs offer an easy approach towards a high concentration of single pitch climbs, perfect for re-learning proper crack technique. This would also only be my second day leading trad, so I was a little apprehensive to say the least. However, after a morning full of easy leads up to 5.8 I was starting to feel a lot more comfortable.

We headed back into town for lunch and enjoyed a wallet friendly value meal from the golden arches before gearing up again. We then headed towards one of the most memorable cracks that I've seen, Exasperator. It is a two-pitch climb following a perfectly cut hand crack that zigzags its way up the otherwise featureless granite until it veers off right into an upwards traverse, and goes at 10a for the first pitch, followed by 10c.

Quin has a tad more climbing talent and confidence than I, and calmly set off up the route making it look relatively easy, albeit strengthy. I opted to follow it on TR, not convinced of my proficiency of placing pro under pressure. This soon turned out to be a wise decision, as my arms quickly pumped out and the climb turned into an all out battle up to the chains - looks like I needed to spend some more time in the gym. The climb consists of rewarding although strenuous finger locks, while the feet are somewhat limited to smearing and edging off of whatever crystals you can find. Finally, just below the chains of the first pitch you are forced into a small cutout in the wall resulting in an insecure mantle, something I imagine would be quite daunting on lead.

I can see why this route made Top 100 Squamish climbs, besides being one of the most aesthetically pleasing splitters that I've seen, it also has fun, quality moves all the way to the top. Next time I'm here I'll definitely have to take my own go at it on lead.

After our success on Exasperator we cooled down on the beginner climbs at Murrin Park, practicing top belaying and anchor building before heading to bed. The next morning we were to climb up Skywalker, another Top 100 climb made up of 5 pitches ranging from 5.4 to 5.8 on the large granite face beside Shannon Falls.

We awoke to the sun shining into the tent, and saw that it was already 9am - not exactly an alpine start. Figuring we were already going to be behind the morning rush at the walls, we casually geared up for the day. Without really consulting the beta on how to reach the base of the route we assumed it was via the main pathways, and followed the crowds of tourists into the park. We quickly realised we were mistaken, as the trails headed away from the granite walls and into the forest towards the falls.

I  definitely felt out of place surrounded by the masses, with full racks hanging from our harnesses loaded with cams, nuts and hexes which banged together with every step. One Asian visitor even proudly proclaimed "Look, mountain climbers!" in broken English to his family as we walked by, while another group quickly pointed their DSLRs in our direction followed by the snap of shutters. Back at the truck we consulted our guidebook and found out that the approach actually ran back towards the highway before dipping back up into the forest.

With our fresh beta we were off and quickly arrived at the base of the wall, and also were greeted with a line up of 3 or 4 parties in front of us. Luckily enough, time seemed to pass quickly as I anticipated my first multi pitch adventure. I was to lead pitches 1, 3 and 5, as they went at 5.7, 5.7 and 5.4. With swing leads my friend would lead pitches 2 and 4, at 5.8 and 5.6. Soon enough it was my turn and I began up the corner that marked the start of pitch one.

A couple of easy moves brings you up to a bolt at which point you shimmy up a step and transfer out of the corner and into the crack above you to the right. Friendly jamming brings you up this crack to the middle of pitch one, with no obvious cruxes to be had. Eventually you reach a point where you can either continue on upwards following the crack, or you can traverse right out onto a slab marked by a couple of bolts until it joins into another crack farther along the wall. Both options will take you to the same large belay ledge at the end of the pitch. I opted to go on upwards, as it was the more direct line, but in hindsight I think traversing out right would have made the pitch more enjoyable, extending it out by another 10 metres or so. Continuing upwards like I did, you will arrive at a final boulder problem which involves laybacking up against the handcrack and then mantling over onto the ledge.

Pitch two starts in a corner at the far end of the belay ledge, and trends up a crack that promises laybacking all the way till the end. Another option is a 10a variation just off to the left up a thin flake which later joins back into the main crack. Pitch two went off without too many issues, with my friend heading up the 10a as it seemed to feel like an easier start, although the flake thins out near the end and runs out of many pro placements. It is the pumpiest pitch on the route, but since I was cleaning following the flake was actually quite enjoyable, the thinner ledges being reminiscent of most of Kelowna's crimpy climbing. After swapping gear and re organizing, it was once again my lead.

Pitch 3 follows a vertical finger crack along a wide flake, until it thins out and you reach a bolt about halfway up. Past this bolt the route trends directly upwards up a series of easier broken cracks until you hit the final crux up high. Right below the chains you will encounter a chimney with a shallow crack running up the center of it. Unluckily for me I had run out of pro in the relevant sizes, and was committed into leading up my first offwidthy problem unprotected. The good news is that the final stretch isn't actually particularly hard, and if you had smaller cams to protect it via the inner crack (think C3s), then there wouldn't be much intimidating about it at all.

Pitch 4  is where this climb gets its name, as the route takes a sharp right turn and traverses across a slab which offers a generous amount of exposure below. unfortunately at this point my GoPro had died so I don't have any screengrabs of this section. Following was once again really enjoyable, and this pitch really is the highlight of the route. Bomber underclings bring you along the traverse, with the foot ledge slowly widening until it's about the size of a narrow sidewalk.

At this point the route is pretty well freed, as the final pitch of 5.4 goes up a very easy slab with a generous amount of bolts which would probably be easier to simul if you were looking to save some time. Standing at the final chains was a pretty rad feeling, and I was truly ecstatic about completing my first multipitch. Its hard to think that just a few years ago I had trouble committing to easy scrambles during hikes.

After I finished top belaying Quin up to the chains, we opted to follow the climbers trail off to the left which takes you to some pools formed midway up the impressive Shannon Falls. After a refresh at the pools we headed back down the steep access trail back to the base of the wall. Tired but content, we marched back towards the parking lot. It had been about 7 hours in total, including our wait at the base of the wall and dip in the pools, and it was now early afternoon.

Soon after slowly packing up we began the long drive home, our trip already feeling like a blur as all of the senses felt over the last few days burned themselves into our memories. The  weight of another work week could already be felt, and my eyelids felt like lead as the sun set while driving down the final stretch of highway. Upon returning home, it didn't take long for me to seek out my sheets and enter a blissful, much needed sleep. Dreams of more adventure carried me away to far places, already craving another multipitch outing. What a memorable, successful whirlwind of two days.

\*\*\* I would highly reccomend this climb to anyone comfortable leading up to 5.8, and it should be noted that every pitch has bolted anchors and good stances, all contributing to it being a spectacular first foray into travelling higher than one rope length.
