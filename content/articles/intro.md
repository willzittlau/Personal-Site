#### My first post...

Welcome to the blog! As of now I really have no idea how often I will be posting in the future, but expect to see some more frequent posts pop up over the next few weeks as I jog my memory of trips I've gone on over the summer. After spending a few hours last night getting the page setup, I think I have everything dialled in for a future volume of uploads, but expect to see some tweaks here and there as I get used to the dynamics of this site. If you would like to get to know me check out my "About" page in the top menu or contact me! For now enjoy this photo of me approaching the main ridge on my favourite trip to date, Mt Tupper. (trip report coming soon)
