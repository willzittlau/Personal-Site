Getting used to being the typical 9-5 weekend warrior, it was time for another mid-summer two and a half day vacation. Alpine climbing plans were in the air with Nelson and Quin, but ultimately forecasted rain made us choose a last minute alternative: Bikepacking. And so, Thursday night had me frantically packing my bike for the next day. My phone also happened to die mid-week so it added another layer of complexity only being able to communicate from my laptop (sorry for the lack of photos from this trip, I personally took zero) Friday's work day passed quickly and it was time to head out. After navigating traffic home, I met up with Quin who had made the drive out from Kelowna at my place and we loaded the bikes into the truck. Originally the plan was to just bike from there but the timing of ferries wasn't going to work out so we shuttled downtown and went off from there. The jaunt down to Horseshoe Bay was uneventful albeit fast paced as we raced to catch the earlier sailing. Down at the ferry we met up with Nelson who had been a few minutes ahead of us, and boarded.

Already well past dark, once off the ferry we biked up to the nearest FSR that we found on maps. Here we set up our bivies and settled down for the night. In the morning there was some amusement when we found out that not even 200m farther up the road was a fully level field which would've been significantly more comfortable than our off camber, road side campsite but c'est l vie. Loading our bikes, we cruised down to Gibsons. An hour later, we were in Sechelt. We had brunch at the Basted Baker (much recommended), and found that once again with ferries timing we had some time to kill. After lounging on the beach for a while checking out our route and visiting one of the local bike shops, we headed off again.

This time we opted to link parts of the sunshine coast trail and logging roads along with the highway to get a bit of gravel riding in on the ~50k stretch to Earl's Cove. Travelling through some beautiful lush BC rainforest, I'm glad we had trailforks to navigate the nest of logging roads through that stretch. At one point we ended up on a blue MTB trail, which was probably pushing the limits on my Diverge with slick 32s, but it held up and made for some fun riding. The last downhill back to the highway was a long gradual descent and a ton of fun racing each other and sliding around on the FSR. Gravel riding puts a lot of fun back into easy MTB terrain so I'll have to do more of it! We made our ferry and landed at Saltery bay. One last 30k grind for the day led us to Powell River. Here we split a campsite and unpacked.

I went for a rejuvenating swim in the ocean, and then we headed up to the grocery store and got an absolute feast for dinner. With a roaring fire, we roasted veggies, salmon, meat and cheese and chatted into the night. Another early morning call had us on yet another ferry this time heading back to the main island. We landed in Comox, and after a brief breakfast at one of the cafe's, began the grind down to Nanaimo. Today was definitely more in the type 2 fun category. No gravel, straight highway, and hot, we pounded out the distance with minimal stops, rounding out a mid morning century ride. The peace and quiet of the coastal island highway was in stark contrast to the inner island highway as they merged for the last 30k, bringing back memories of the summer before when I rode this route all the way down to Victoria in my first long day on the saddle. We loaded up our bikes for the final ferry ride back to Horshoe Bay and stretched our sore muscles. Finally, back on the mainland, all we had was one last 30k ride back into the city. Nelson took off and me and Quin kept it chill, cruising our way back. Prior to this trip I had only logged a couple hundred kms on the bike and Quin had even less, so we were both hurting by this point. Back to the hustle of downtown Vancouver, we were greeted by rain on the last half-hour of our ride.

Packing up the bikes, we said our goodbyes and headed home for some much needed rest before the work week started up again. In total our route was roughly 280km with 4 ferry rides. If you're on the west coast I really recommend this loop, tons of options for resupplies and camping along the way as well as ample gravel additions. A fun extension would be all the way down to Victoria as well. This trip was a great change of pace from all of the running that had mainly made up my free time in the summer.
