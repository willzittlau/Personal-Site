Its been quite some time since my last post, but that's what happens when school picks up full time again I guess. Hopefully I'll have some more time to post, but in the mean time here's a quick edit I threw together of the other day ski touring in Rogers Pass up on Grizzly Shoulder! I'm planning on starting to make quick edits like these more regularly in the future, so here's a taste of what's to come.
