Doing a road ride? slap on some narrower tires (ie those 32c Roubaix tires that pair so nicely) and pull off all of your frame bags. Same goes for if you want to do some cross riding, just pickup some knobbies and you're good to go. Commuting? Choose your tire and throw the framepack back on as well as any other bags you have. Bikepacking/Touring? Add on the stuffcage, handlebar harness and either get a stabilizer seat pack or eyeletted clamp and run a pannier on the back and you're off on your next pedal powered adventure. If you have the CGR post just make sure to swap out for an alloy post as neither an eyeletted clamp nor the new clamped seatpacks are meant for use with carbon posts. My setups are most likely going to be this:\n\n<center><b>Road -  Seatbag, plus water cages (might add toptube bag for longer rides)!</b></center>\n\n![Imgur](https://i.imgur.com/gHZkHdr.jpg)\n\n<center><b>Commuting - Above + Framepack and Handlebar Bag!</b></center>\n\n![Imgur](https://i.imgur.com/ol3BdKn.jpg)\n\n<center><b>Touring - Above + Stuffcage and swap out the Handlebar bag for the Handlebar Harness, plus a porcelain rocket Vera Seatpack and a revelate toptube bag</b></center>\n\n![Imgur](https://i.imgur.com/DHOgr76.jpg)\n\nA note on Speacialized's bikepacking bag lineup. These things are pretty sweet. Very weatherproof, made with a very durable face fabric. However, every piece is also very overbuilt. The weights on these things aren't impressive, and most of the straps are annoying long. The upside is that I do expect these to last a lifetime, and every piece adds tons of useful storage to the bike. They might not be as good as the lighter weight options in the niche market of bikepacking, but its cool that Specialized realized it's a growing market and piggybacked off of existing ideas  to make a very solid first lineup. It'll be interesting to see what future generations of the Burra Burra bags bring.\n\nI seriously  can't wait to test out this bike for a variety of different uses. I really do think it's as close as you can come to a one bike quiver for the road/gravel, (as long as you aren't racing) and it'll be interesting to see if it has any limitations. Only having logged a few quick rides so far, it's hard to really give an in-depth review on the ride characteristics, but what I can say is that those rides have been a blast. For my first dive into the world of road biking, I really do think I just found myself a lifetime frame and something I will continue to reach for whenever I want to go out on a new unknown road or my longer rides. I've also been dreaming up some bigger goals with this bike, and I'm excited to share them once they come together. See you out on the roads!","dir":"/articles","path":"/articles/first-look-2018-specialized-diverge","extension":".md","slug":"first-look-2018-specialized-diverge","updatedAt":"2020-09-06T21:25:45.790Z","readingTime":"8 min read","meta":{"version":0,"revision":0,"created":1599716451276},"$loki":2},{"title":"Garibaldi Neve Traverse In A Day","createdAt":"2019-04-14T00:00:00.000Z","description":"A marathon of walking with skis on","img":"https://i.imgur.com/zbhUBNuh.png","alt":"Garibaldi Neve","featured":"yes","tags":["skiing","garibaldi neve","squamish","backcountry"],"toc":[],"body":{"type":"root","children":[{"type":"element","tag":"p","props":{},"children":[{"type":"text","value":"After an after work mission to Squamish for some climbing a couple weeks ago, Nelson and I made plans for another ski traverse.

I had really been wanting to spend a day up there in the summer since doing the Neve, so I didn't need much more convincing. I quickly packed and shoved the last of my gels from the last two long runs into my vest and set my alarm.\n\nI hadn't really looked at any beta whatsoever, so I was in no rush when getting up in the morning. At around 8:30 I rolled up to the rubble creek trailhead, and was shocked that I grabbed one of the last roadside parking spots. I knew that the ridge was a popular hike, but hadn't seen the extent of Instagram's blown out spots in the lower mainland yet. Soon after parking I was on my way up the switchbacks.\n\nThis section was pretty uneventful, I was jog-walking and not burning myself out on the 1000m climb. Still, I must've passed about 200 hundred people on the way up, it was ridiculous how many hikers there were. Just over an hour later, I broke out into the meadows. Here I stopped to refill water and take a quick break at the first creek I saw, and then continued on my way towards the ridge.\n\nBefore long I was transitioning from dirt to talus and the trail steepened dramatically. I slowed down again and hiked up the last climb to the top of the ridge. I looked back at the sprawling line-up of hikers and was surprised to see another couple runners up on their way, and got passed by one of them on the climb. And then, I was at the top. There's a reason why this hike is so popular, the view really is breathtaking. Garibaldi lake is absolutely stunning and has such a stark contrast against the sprawling glaciers and peaks behind. I hung out here for a while and enjoyed the view while resting. It was still early, so I decided to add some adventure and follow the ridge back down into the valley instead of retracing my steps on the trail. Steep scree descents ensued, I was cautious about rolling an ankle. I even got a bonus of glissading down some snow, although I had to kick steps down the latter half as it steepened (front pointing is not a ton of fun in trail runners).\n\nBack at the bottom of the valley, I beelined it straight back to the trail junction at end of the meadows. Still with plenty of time left in the day, I filled up on water and nutrition again and took the junction towards the Tusk. I was definitely getting tired so I hiked pretty much the entire climb this time but still made good progress. The scree elevator seemed endless but soon enough I was rapping around the lower flanks of the peak. Here I encountered another lineup to climb the 3rd class gulley up to the summit. I hadn't planned on the tusk that day so I hadn't brought a helmet, but I wished for it now with everyone on the route kicking stuff off. And so I waited a solid 30 minutes for people to filter through before the route was clear and raced up. Halfway up a group started descending so I wrapped over to the right off route and scrambled up the choss fest before linking back onto the climbers trail to avoid the rockfall.\n\nThe view from the summit was better than the ridge, because you still got a view of the lake but also the whole valley in front of the ridge as well. I took it all in and enjoyed the summit to myself before beginning the descent back down. Luckily I tagged onto the back of a group who had started down a few minutes earlier so I got to avoid the rockfall this time. Racing back down the scree slope was a big highlight of the day, a mix between freefalling and glissading back down brought me back to the junction in 1/10th of the time it took to get up.\n\nStill with a bit of energy to spare, I veered left down the garibaldi lake trail and endured the switchbacks to the lake for a quick dip. My aching muscles appreciated the glacial water and rejuvenated my energy. The rubble creek descent wore on me and the switchbacks didn't feel any less endless than when I descended from the Neve. Finally I was down and back at the truck, where I took a quick nap in the back before driving home (with a quick pitstop at Mag's for some much needed calories).\n\nIn total the day was about 35Km with somewhere between 2500-3000m of vert, my watch messed up the baro reading when I went for a swim with it so unfortunately it read 6000+. Below is a quick edit I made of the day + a link to the strava run.\n\n<center><iframe src=\"https://player.vimeo.com/video/368664376\" width=\"640\" height=\"360\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"autoplay; fullscreen\" allowfullscreen></iframe>\n<p><a href=\"https://vimeo.com/368664376\">Panorama Ridge and Black Tusk run</a> from <a href=\"https://vimeo.com/user80709827\">Will Zittlau</a> on <a href=\"https://vimeo.com\">Vimeo</a>.</p></center>\n\nLink to GPS recording: https://www.strava.com/activities/2588310700","dir":"/articles","path":"/articles/garibaldi-rambling-panorama-ridge-and-the-tusk-trail-run","extension":".md","slug":"garibaldi-rambling-panorama-ridge-and-the-tusk-trail-run","updatedAt":"2020-09-07T04:42:37.462Z","readingTime":"5 min read","meta":{"version":0,"revision":0,"created":1599716451506},"$loki":4},{"title":"Half Marathon","createdAt":"2017-09-12T00:00:00.000Z","description":"My first long run","img":"","alt":"Half Marathon","featured":"no","tags":["running","okanagan","half","marathon"],"toc":[],"body":{"type":"root","children":[{"type":"element","tag":"p","props":{},"children":[{"type":"element","tag":"img","props":{"alt":"Imgur","src":"https://i.imgur.com/8AGxLRhh.jpg"},"children":[]}]},{"type":"text","value":"\n"},{"type":"element","tag":"p","props":{},"children":[{"type":"text","value":"Yesterday after work I ran my first Half Marathon.

After getting pretty solid with back-end work on some personal web apps using Flask, I wanted to turn my attention towards the ever so trendy JAMstack and new JS frameworks for more front-end experience . Re-writing my wordpress blog from scratch and deploying it as either an SPA or full-static seemed like the perfect choice.\r\n\r\nThat left me with deciding which site generator to use. This whole project started by discovering Jekyll, and discovering how much I liked writing content in markdown. The only thing was that I wanted practice with one of the new JS frameworks and I didn't want my project to be in Ruby. Next I discovered 11ty, which seems awesome, but I wanted to have more of a challenge. That left me with React/Gatsby which seems like it's the most popular,  or Vue - in which I found VuePress, Nuxt, or Gridsome. I liked Vue over React from the little experience I had, so I started there. VuePress doesn't seem as customizable as the other two, and I wasn't wanting to learn GraphQL ontop of a new framework so Nuxt it was. Luckily for me, Nuxt just came out with Nuxt Content and full-static rendering in June, which was absolutely perfect.\r\n\r\nI started plugging away from the boilerplate created by running\r\n`npm create-nuxt-app` and opted in to use Bulma as the CSS framework. Thankfully the Nuxt/Vue documentation is really helpful, as I spent hours going through it  to fully understand each component/module I wanted to add.  Their introduction tutorial [found here](https://nuxtjs.org/blog/creating-blog-with-nuxt-content/) was a lifesaver and worth browsing through if you're interested in using the framework.\r\n\r\nI'm not going to go into too much of the code, since a lot of it was only lightly modified from the tutorial for actually rendering each blog post, but I'll highlight onto what I did add. If you want to go to my repo to view every vue component, all the power to you! The biggest adaptation was adding a /tags path to greatly improve site navigation and organize posts by type. This was as easy as adding a tags object in the markdown YAML, and this vue component:\r\n```javascript\r\n// pages/tags/_slug.vue\r\n<template>\r\n  <div class=\"container journal\">\r\n    <h1>Tags: {{ $route.params.slug }}</h1>\r\n    <ul>\r\n      <li v-for=\"article of articles\" :key=\"article.slug\">\r\n        <NuxtLink class=\"journal-post\" :to=\"{ name: 'blog-slug', params: { slug: article.slug } }\">\r\n          <div>\r\n            <h2 class=\"journal-title\">{{ article.title }}</h2>\r\n            <p class=\"journal-excerpt\">{{ article.description }}</p>\r\n            <span class=\"journal-excerpt\">\r\n              {{ formatDate(article.createdAt) }} &bull;\r\n              {{ article.readingTime }}\r\n            </span>\r\n          </div>\r\n        </NuxtLink>\r\n      </li>\r\n    </ul>\r\n  </div>\r\n</template>\r\n\r\n<script>\r\nexport default {\r\n  methods: {\r\n    formatDate(date) {\r\n      const options = { year: \"numeric\", month: \"long\", day: \"numeric\" };\r\n      return new Date(date).toLocaleDateString(\"en\", options);\r\n    },\r\n  },\r\n  async asyncData({ params, error, $content }) {\r\n    try {\r\n      const articles = await $content(\"articles\", { deep: true })\r\n        .where({ tags: { $contains: params.slug } })\r\n        .sortBy(\"createdAt\", \"desc\")\r\n        .fetch();\r\n      return { articles };\r\n    } catch (err) {\r\n      error({\r\n        statusCode: 404,\r\n        message: \"Page could not be found\",\r\n      });\r\n    }\r\n  },\r\n};\r\n</script>\r\n```\r\nIn the script I also included a small function for date formatting as well as an error catching function. I also added features posts on pages/index.vue by adding a \"featured\" component on the markdown YAML, and the code seen below.\r\n```javascript\r\n// pages/index.vue\r\n<template>\r\n  <div>\r\n    <Hero />\r\n    <h1>Featured</h1>\r\n      <div v-for=\"article of articles\" :key=\"article.slug\">\r\n        <NuxtLink :to=\"{ name: 'blog-slug', params: { slug: article.slug } }\">\r\n          <img :src=\"article.img\" :alt=\"article.alt\" class=\"thumbnail\" />\r\n          <h3 class=\"project-title\">{{ article.title }}</h3>\r\n            <span v-for=\"tag of article.tags\" :key=\"tag.id\">{{tag}}</span>\r\n        </NuxtLink>\r\n      </div>\r\n    <SocialFeed />\r\n  </div>\r\n</template>\r\n\r\n<script>\r\nexport default {\r\n  async asyncData({ $content }) {\r\n    const articles = await $content(\"articles\", { deep: true })\r\n      .where({ featured: { $contains: \"yes\" } })\r\n      .sortBy(\"updatedAt\", \"desc\")\r\n      .fetch();\r\n    return {\r\n      articles,\r\n    };\r\n  },\r\n};\r\n</script>\r\n```\r\nAnother additon is that I added custom error routes, however I can't find the article that I read but if I do I'll add a link to it here.\r\n```javascript\r\n// layouts/error.vue\r\n<template>\r\n  <div class=\"nuxt-error\">\r\n    <component :is=\"errorPage\" :error=\"error\" />\r\n  </div>\r\n</template>\r\n\r\n<script>\r\nimport error404 from \"~/components/error/404.vue\";\r\nimport error500 from \"~/components/error/500.vue\";\r\nexport default {\r\n  name: \"nuxt-error\",\r\n  layout: \"default\", // optional\r\n  props: {\r\n    error: {\r\n      type: Object,\r\n      default: () => {},\r\n    },\r\n  },\r\n  computed: {\r\n    errorPage() {\r\n      if (this.error.statusCode === 404) {\r\n        return error404;\r\n      }\r\n      // catch everything else\r\n      return error500;\r\n    },\r\n  },\r\n};\r\n</script>\r\n```\r\n```javascript\r\n// components/404.vue\r\n<script>\r\nexport default {\r\n  name: \"error-404\",\r\n  props: {\r\n    error: {\r\n      type: Object,\r\n      default: () => {},\r\n    },\r\n  },\r\n};\r\n</script>\r\n```\r\nFinally, for styling I used Bulma.css for this project, which made workflow quick and easy, especially for responsive displays on mobile. The next one I'm looking at checking out is Tailwind.css, there's a ton of Nuxt tutorials out there which are using it. I got some heavy inspiration from [this Gridsome theme](https://gridsome-forestry.netlify.app/) , but since it was written using Gridsome it was fun re-purposing and adapting it to work with Nuxt. It was also really helpful having a visual aid to direct my style decisions, I can see why teams use image templates prior to building.\r\n\r\nAnd that it! In about a week of work I went from an empty VS Code directory to the site you're reading this on now.

It's dead simple to use and works, and I don't need a CMS. I can write my .md content on desktop in Typora and push it to GitHub for seamless deployment.

It takes you through beautiful old growth forests, with spectacular views of the ocean never more than a few kilometres apart. This run had been on my mind after another one of my friends had ran it two summers before, and is actually one of the reasons I started training for ultras. I would say the biggest crux of the trip is trying to figure out rides as it’s a point to point run in a relatively remote area, so with the offer on the table for James’ brother to shuttle us it was hard to say no.

Starting shortly after 7, our ran began with a short jaunt of fun single-track down to the first crossing at Mystic Beach. This section happened to be the highlight of the day for me with the final descent breaking us out from the trees and descending down a steep wooden staircase to the beach.

I remember at one-point James stuck his foot down in a particularly deep pool, and it came back out without a shoe!

We raced each other up the last hill and were completely spent at the finish. Here we met up again with James’ brother who loaded us up with water and snacks for the drive home. FYI, a 2-hour drive in the back of a small car isn’t too kind to sore muscles.

The Juan de Fuca Marine trail is a 47km trail on the west coast of Vancouver Island with around 1800m of elevation gain, starting (or finishing, depending on direction) just 10km below the terminus of the ultra famous West Coast trail. It takes you through beautiful old growth forests, with spectacular views of the ocean never more than a few kilometres apart. This run had been on my mind after another one of my friends had ran it two summers before, and is actually one of the reasons I started training for ultras. I would say the biggest crux of the trip is trying to figure out rides as it’s a point to point run in a relatively remote area, so with the offer on the table for James’ brother to shuttle us it was hard to say no. And so, on another Friday afternoon after work I found myself on the ferry headed to Victoria for our rendezvous.\n\nAfter getting organized, we drove up to Sombrio Beach, the halfway point of our run, and set up camp for the night. Early the next morning, the ~25km drive back to the start of the trailhead at China Beach made me realize just how long the day was going to feel. Starting shortly after 7, our ran began with a short jaunt of fun single-track down to the first crossing at Mystic Beach. This section happened to be the highlight of the day for me with the final descent breaking us out from the trees and descending down a steep wooden staircase to the beach. Here there was a thick fog hanging over the ocean with the vibrant sunrise bathing the sea of clouds in a million different hues of morning light, and the contrast between the dark, dense early morning forest and this breathtaking view was truly special.\n\nThe next 20K to Chin Beach was the biggest slog, with seemingly endless hills. Although the climbs are never much more than 500 feet, the trail almost never stays flat. The trail also has a bit of a reputation for being a mud pit, and it definitely lived up to it for us. I remember at one-point James stuck his foot down in a particularly deep pool, and it came back out without a shoe! By the time we made it back to Sombrio we had stopped avoiding the mud and had accepted it as our reality. Here we stopped for lunch and refuelled for the second half of the trail.\n\nWith the worst of it behind us the next few beach crossings flew by. However, by the last 10K we were starting to slow down and were definitely feeling the added effort of navigating across all of the logs, branches and mud. Luckily when you travel South to North the trail gets continually easier and we managed to run the entire last portion of the trail from Parkinson to Botanical Beach. We raced each other up the last hill and were completely spent at the finish. Here we met up again with James’ brother who loaded us up with water and snacks for the drive home. FYI, a 2-hour drive in the back of a small car isn’t too kind to sore muscles. Back in Victoria, we hobbled out of the car and hit Bin4 for their late night ½ price burgers where I unapologetically devoured 2 full meals. After I was honestly still hungry, so I think I needed it.\n\nIf you have solid hiking / running experience and you’re fit, I would highly recommend doing this trail in a day. One important thing to note is that this trail is very dependant on the beach crossings, and some areas are inaccessible during high tide. We managed to land on a day where the tides coincided roughly with our rate of travel, so we never had issue. It took us just under 10 hours with a ratio of probably 70% hiking 30% running and never felt too hard, always enjoyable.

On the weekend before school started up in September 2018, I managed to squeeze in one last summer trip with Levi, Colette, Inuk, Adam and Remi. The following is transcribed from a journal entry I wrote while on the trip.**\n\n**Day 1**: I slept in the back of my truck on Inuk's driveway in Revelstoke for a 5AM wakeup. Everyone rendezvoused here and, after discussing gear, we were off by 7am. A quick stop in Golden and we were on our way up the FSR. I'm sad to report that I must've murdered at least 100 dragonflies, I've never seen so many in my life! After chicken wiring the vehicles, we headed out at around 1PM. The approach is only ~5km, but also has ~1km of vert and our 65lb packs beat us down. Colette was carrying more than half her body weight! The highlight was coming out of the lower talus fields into the upper meadows, offering stunning views of the spires and sprawling glaciers. After setting up camp at boulder campground, we headed up to Applebee to take photos.\n\n**Day 2:** 5AM start, our eyes are set on Pigeon Spire's famous west ridge. Sore shoulders from the day before, but today our packs are much more manageable. The Snowpatch-Bugaboo col has lost its easy snow slope and is now a steep gully of choss, so we will ascend via the bugaboo glacier. Climbing up the trail to the Kain hut, we followed the moraines to climber's left up to the base of Son of a Snowpatch and skirted its edge to the toe of the glacier. Crampons and axes out, we began up the glacier. As we approached the first plateau, crevasses began appearing in front of us. Luckily at this time of year all the crevasses have opened up and very few have snow bridges left, and the ones that do have obvious sags. We continued, slogging our way up. Finally, past the Pigeon Feathers, we approached a large 'schrund split by a rock island. we managed to find a route through, negotiating a 10 foot wide by hundred foot long gaping maw with no bottom in sight.\n\nBy now the weather was looking worse with looming black clouds ahead of us. We pushed up a snow marine and arrived at the base of the ridge in full winter conditions. Looking across the Vowell, the Howser towers were engulfed in dark storms. From our vantage point, I could tell that the route wasn't going to go today. The upper ridge was caked in verglass and rime, and even the lower slabs were dusted in a thin layer of slippery snice. We scrambled as high as we felt comfortable, maybe 50-100m up the route, before unanimously agreeing to bail. None of us had any winter climbing experience nor ice gear besides long 20cm glacier screws, so for the current conditions, we were ill equipped. Only 3 hours into our day, we causally strolled back down the glacier, glissading the snow slopes when possible and taking photos. There was one tense moment when Colette lost her footing and slipped, separated from her axe which was firmly in place above where she had plunged it. Luckily this was only a moderate snow slope and she quickly managed to arrest herself by kicking in her crampons and grabbing at the snow. Not 10m below was a narrow crevasse.\n\nEventually, we landed back on the plateau. With no other objectives for the day, I suggested we practice crevasse rescues while we had convenient access. Inuk volunteered to rap down off a couple screws, while I prepped a 3:1. I was pleased by the efficiency of it, and hauled up Inuk's 140lb frame with next to no difficulty. On our way back, we hugged Son of a Snowpatch a little tighter, and ended up at a single rap station to get down onto the moraines that led back to the Kain hut.\n\nAfter arriving back at the Kain hut and enjoying the sunshine for a few moments, our relaxation was quickly disrupted by a man frantically waving his arms and whistling from the top of the Dome. Grabbing our packs, we tried our best to jog up the 300m as fast as we could. A lady had tweaked her knee and was unable to put weight on it. However, by the time we had arrived she had already been stabilized and one of the other campers had questionably called a heli in... We bouldered around on the rocks by the camp until the heli arrived and then walked back down to the hut with the camp custodian, who graciously gave use some fresh grown tomatoes once we arrived back. Down back at boulder camp, Inuk and Remi set up a top rope off one of the large rocks above us and began playing around on the moderate routes. Dark fell, it started raining, and it was time for bed.\n\n**Day 3**: Woke up for an alpine start to rain, went back to bed. Set my alarm an hour later and woke up to snow this time, went back to bed. Slept in, it was still snowing, but I eventually hauled myself out of bed. Four of us huddled under a single 5x8 tarp to make breakfast, the typical coffee & oatmeal. After breakfast the fog lifted and we were afforded with a stunning view of all the spires in a fresh coat, glowing in the morning light. We hiked up to the hut and socialized with those inside while enjoying more coffee and reading old stories in the hut's copies of the CAJ.\n\nAround 11am the sun had finally burned up the last of the clouds and it began to warm up, so it was time to move. Today was my last climbing day, with my first day of school starting up in less than 48 hours. Because of the fresh snow we decided not to attempt any of the major spires, but instead set our sights on a 4th class route up above the Dome. We packed our backpacks and headed up again.

Another 10 minutes of scrambling over loose, slush covered rocks and we were at the first set of slabs. One at a time we soloed up and navigated our way towards the snowy summit. Eventually the last pitch presented itself and we made quick work of it, assembling on the summit. It turns out we had climbed the peak in less than 30 minutes, so it was just a tease of climbing in the Bugs, but fun nonetheless.\n\nAfter food and photos we headed back down, route finding made easy with our up tracks embedded in the 4\" of fresh snow. The descent was even faster and in no time we were back at the col. Remi, Inuk and I made a quick detour to the glacial lake above camp and had a very refreshing dip.

I woke up at 5, said my goodbyes to the boys heading out, and returned to bed. Around 8 I stirred again, finished packing up, and made the journey back up to the hut. Here I enjoyed a coffee and reflected on the trip, writing these notes, and started the downhill journey to the car. Letting gravity aid me, I was on the road by 10 and back home in short order.\n\nI cannot wait to return to the bugs with more knowledge and strength, and with better weather. The rock quality truly is pristine and there's a reason why it has gained such international popularity. Until then, the spires will be waiting.\n","dir":"/articles","path":"/articles/lots-of-walking-not-a-lot-of-climbing-in-the-bugaboos","extension":".md","slug":"lots-of-walking-not-a-lot-of-climbing-in-the-bugaboos","updatedAt":"2020-09-07T04:18:38.298Z","readingTime":"8 min read","meta":{"version":0,"revision":0,"created":1599716452496},"$loki":11},{"title":"Marathon day hike: Mount Fosthall","createdAt":"2017-09-21T00:00:00.000Z","description":"First big effort in the backcountry","img":"","alt":"Mt Fosthall","featured":"no","tags":["hiking","mt fosthall","monashees"],"toc":[],"body":{"type":"root","children":[{"type":"element","tag":"p","props":{},"children":[{"type":"text","value":"On this trip we decided to take a break from climbing, and instead made plans on an overnight trip to Monashee Provincial Park, just outside of Cherryville BC.

The ending of our trip was very similar to Tupper, and as we passed the last 2km sign we both broke out into a jog, and then into an all our run as the last few turns flew by under our feet. Fully sprinting to the truck, I let out a cry of joy but immediately began to pull of my boots as the burning pain on my heels started to drown out the adrenaline.\n\nAlthough our trip was technically unsuccessful, it was still a long day of exciting type 2 fun in the mountains. We hadn’t summitted Fosthall, and we hadn’t quite hit the 42km distance of a proper marathon, but we had still managed to complete 41+ kms of hiking over mountainous terrain, unexpected and loose chossy scrambling, as well as doubled our original hiking goal all in under 15 hours truck to truck, and I wouldn’t have it any other way. My socks were bloody and feet exhausted after carrying me so far and being submerged in the snow for 6+ hours, but all the exhaustion in our bodies couldn’t wipe the grins off our faces. After drinking every drop of liquid we had left stashed in the truck (Gatorade, beer, day old tea??) and snacking on the remainder of our provisions, we continued on our way home. Once again I battled sleep the whole drive home, (a trend I really need to stop) and was relieved as I finally pulled down my driveway.\n\n**Lessons learned from this trip:**\n\n1. Bring a tent repair kit & don’t pitch it as tight if you want to guarantee a peaceful, bug free sleep\n2. Treat blisters early on and not after your feet are soaked and already raw\n3. Don’t catch your carbon pole on a rock while running/sliding down snow (it will explode)\n4. Consult route beta before leaving, and follow the obvious trail unless you want to end up scrambling along a chossy ridge somewhere like us\n\n&nbsp;\n&nbsp;\n![Imgur](https://i.imgur.com/GZ6ja2zh.jpg)\n","dir":"/articles","path":"/articles/marathon-day-hike-mount-fosthall","extension":".md","slug":"marathon-day-hike-mount-fosthall","updatedAt":"2020-09-06T22:16:51.651Z","readingTime":"9 min read","meta":{"version":0,"revision":0,"created":1599716452630},"$loki":12},{"title":"Mt Tupper, West Ridge","createdAt":"2017-09-08T00:00:00.000Z","description":"The story of my first alpine climb","img":"https://i.imgur.com/2QY8HJAh.jpg","alt":"Summit of Mt Tupper","featured":"yes","tags":["climbing","rogers pass","alpine"],"toc":[],"body":{"type":"root","children":[{"type":"element","tag":"p","props":{},"children":[{"type":"text","value":"Me and Quin were gearing up for another work weekend adventure in early July, with big goals in mind.

From here the summit is protected by a 5.3 corner with lots of exposure (fun!!!) and some more easy 5th to get you up to the top. We once again opted to rope up but after climbing it I would recommend just short roping it to save some time if you felt comfortable on the terrain below it - the 5.3 section is very short and the only real challenge is the exposure (air beneath your feet all the way down to the glacier).

Back on course, we headed up through the village one last time and began the final climb, once more to the top of the resort. I was still feeling pretty weak through this second climb but luckily started finding a rhythm again once we began our final descent. Quin finally had a low point in the race (I was beginning to think this run was too easy for him) through the muddy section but toughed it out for the last few kms. Finally, less than 1km to go, we opened it up for a fun sprint finish to the line.\n\nOur final time was 8:11, a little slower than my original goal of 7 hours but still respectable considering course conditions and that there was 2200M of climbing! Overall it was an amazing experience and I recommend everyone should try and do something that seems out of reach; I still don’t consider myself a runner. After a shower and a couple hours of relaxation my real test of endurance came after the race when I was faced with a 4-hour drive back to Vancouver to make it in time for work on Monday morning! Thanks to Quin and Matt for sharing the day with me, and for MEC/Bigwhite for hosting such a rad event!\n\n![Imgur](https://i.imgur.com/0DQ9zD2h.jpg)\n\n![Imgur](https://i.imgur.com/MB6KwB5h.jpg)\n\nLink to Strava activity: [https://www.strava.com/activities/2513372121](https://www.strava.com/activities/2513372121)\n","dir":"/articles","path":"/articles/my-first-ultra-mec-50k-at-big-white","extension":".md","slug":"my-first-ultra-mec-50k-at-big-white","updatedAt":"2020-09-07T04:35:37.467Z","readingTime":"6 min read","meta":{"version":0,"revision":0,"created":1599716453024},"$loki":15},{"title":"Quick Update","createdAt":"2018-02-11T00:00:00.000Z","description":"","img":"","alt":"Skiing in Roger's Pass","featured":"no","tags":["skiing"],"toc":[],"body":{"type":"root","children":[{"type":"element","tag":"p","props":{},"children":[{"type":"text","value":"Its been quite some time since my last post, but that's what happens when school picks up full time again I guess.

I have to say, I'm really glad that I had to do this traverse before the huts are operating as I do think it will change the nature of the traverse, it really does feel remote. However, I'm also really excited to do it again with the huts, and I think it's for the better that they're getting installed considering how much popularity the route already has.\n\n![Imgur](https://i.imgur.com/9nzGtWrh.jpg)\n\nLast climb up Whirlwind Pass.. We started on the far left across the valley the day before\n\nFinally, we ripped the skins for the last time and started down into Singing Pass. Here we spilt up as I pushed hard and skied the entirety of Singing Pass in one go, something like 12km of skintrack/ski out/luge from hell with the packs. My quads were protesting and some of the sections got pretty loose (I didn't see the sign and caution corner was 0.005 seconds away from claiming my life), but I managed to get down in one piece about 50 minutes later. Skiing out onto the lower groomer and right into the heart of Whistler Village was a bit of a culture shock after being in such a remote feeling area, but definitely a welcome sight. It was still before 5 PM and we had completed the traverse in about 29 hours total, with 12 of those spent in the tent. I layered up and waited for Nelson to come down, which he did about half an hour later, looking pretty haggard. We walked back to the truck stoked and celebrated with some Whistler Brewing chestnut ale, fitting, and also my favourite seasonal brew. One pit stop on the way home included a burrito at Mag's 99 in Squamish, and before we knew it we were back in Vancouver. I dropped off Nelson at his place and rushed home, ready for some much needed rest before the work week ahead. I strongly recommend this traverse for anyone in the Whistler area, it's something special.\n","dir":"/articles","path":"/articles/spearhead-traverse","extension":".md","slug":"spearhead-traverse","updatedAt":"2020-09-07T04:49:27.445Z","readingTime":"12 min read","meta":{"version":0,"revision":0,"created":1599716453101},"$loki":17},{"title":"Sunshine Coast bikepacking","createdAt":"2020-02-02T00:00:00.000Z","description":"The ultimate weekend warrior coastal bike route","img":"https://i.imgur.com/8aqdbP5h.jpg","alt":"Bikepacking rigs","featured":"no","tags":["biking","bikepacking","sunshine coast","vancouver island"],"toc":[],"body":{"type":"root","children":[{"type":"element","tag":"p","props":{},"children":[{"type":"element","tag":"img","props":{"alt":"Imgur","src":"https://i.imgur.com/8aqdbP5h.jpg"},"children":[]}]},{"type":"text","value":"\n"},{"type":"element","tag":"p","props":{},"children":[{"type":"text","value":"Getting used to being the typical 9-5 weekend warrior, it was time for another mid-summer two and a half day vacation.
