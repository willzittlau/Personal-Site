I'm glad we took the hut-based option, as I believe the learning is way more intimate than a course at a resort would have been.  It couldn't have happened without the Chalet staff, Cristoph, Sean and Monica. Cristoph is a gnarled man who fits the textbook picture of a weathered alpinist and has an endless wealth of knowledge. I guess that'll happen after guiding in Alaska for over a decade... Sean is a younger guide but comes with a ton of experience and I appreciated his straight-forward approach to instruction and giving immediate honest feedback, whether it was good or bad. Monica was our chef for the week and makes unbelievably good meals, and most impressively cooks everything using a woodfire stove. Managing temperature control by changing burn rates and amounts was truly impressive to watch. The course layout went like this: Wake up around 6am, go outside to the weather plot for morning weather obs. Over breakfast, discuss the forecast and make a plan for the day. Make lunch to go and spend the next few hours out in the field digging pits, terrain selection, and best of all, SKIING! Back at the hut, do evening weather obs, and cover new course material over dinner. After dinner was a relaxed, social environment and we had an amazing group. Living in close proximity with 12 people was bound to get tense but actually everyone got along really well which great.

Right after New Year's I took my Ops 1 up in Smither's BC with one of my good friends.  Hungover, I began the 1000km drive due north from Kelowna. Battling winter roads (the theme of driving on this trip) I stopped in Quesnel and picked up Chris.  The drive wasn't very eventful besides being sheet ice for approximately 200km. Oh, and we stopped in Fraser Lake for food at a joint called Senior Duggies, where we had the pleasure of being served by Duggie himself. The food was average at best, but the character of the place and the owner makes it a worthy rest stop. (Example, he asked if we were \"boarders\", we assumed snowboarders but he actually meant boogie boarders, turns out he lived in Mexico for over 10 years but boogie boarded instead of surfed <span>&#128514;</span>)\r\n\r\n![Imgur](https://i.imgur.com/97tjVgWl.jpg)\r\n\r\nPulling into Smithers, we walked around the town for a bit before meeting up with Chris's friend from raft guiding, went out for dinner, and stayed at their place for the night. The next morning we got dropped off at the airport for our meet-up and heli shuttle up to the Chalet. I was really excited as I'd never been in a helicopter before, and after the rest of the crew found that out, graciously offered me the front seat! Visibility wasn't great and it was snowing hard, but a window opened up and we flew in. It had been absolutely nuking the past couple days, and we snuck in right in the middle of the storm. We had to circle around because the hut got dusted by a size 4 peeling off of Loft peak (photo below, the slide came off of the center glacier and pulled down the entire face). It was going to be an exciting week for sure.\r\n\r\n![Imgur](https://i.imgur.com/QR4til3.jpg)\r\n\r\n![Imgur](https://i.imgur.com/HP1vS6Yl.jpg)\r\n\r\nOnce at the lodge we shuttled our stuff in and got set up. Me and Chris were on the first flight in and got lucky enough for first dibs on a room. After settling in, the course began. Ops is a pretty intensive week, with classroom hours being well over 12 hours a day. I'm glad we took the hut-based option, as I believe the learning is way more intimate than a course at a resort would have been.  It couldn't have happened without the Chalet staff, Cristoph, Sean and Monica. Cristoph is a gnarled man who fits the textbook picture of a weathered alpinist and has an endless wealth of knowledge. I guess that'll happen after guiding in Alaska for over a decade... Sean is a younger guide but comes with a ton of experience and I appreciated his straight-forward approach to instruction and giving immediate honest feedback, whether it was good or bad. Monica was our chef for the week and makes unbelievably good meals, and most impressively cooks everything using a woodfire stove. Managing temperature control by changing burn rates and amounts was truly impressive to watch. The course layout went like this: Wake up around 6am, go outside to the weather plot for morning weather obs. Over breakfast, discuss the forecast and make a plan for the day. Make lunch to go and spend the next few hours out in the field digging pits, terrain selection, and best of all, SKIING! Back at the hut, do evening weather obs, and cover new course material over dinner. After dinner was a relaxed, social environment and we had an amazing group. Living in close proximity with 12 people was bound to get tense but actually everyone got along really well which great. The basement sauna was a key nightly routine, followed by card games and drinks before bed. \r\n\r\n![Imgur](https://i.imgur.com/TyVByDH.jpg)\r\n\r\nChris and I figured out a system to get some extra sleep, noticing the morning traffic jam starting at 6 each day. Breakfast was at 7, so if we slept until 6:30 and let everyone shuffle out the door, by the time we went out for weather obs we'd basically have the station to ourselves and be done just in time for the morning lesson!

is scraping the ETFs for their inner holdings. This is the meat of the app, and also unfortunately the most prone to breaking if the site providers ever change their structure. I started off by scraping Yahoo Finance themselves, but they only return the top 10 holdings. I later updated to ycharts which returns the top 25. To do this, you just pass the ticker column through a loop into a standard URL format for whatever you're scraping from and use BS4 to return the table containing the holdings. Append this to a master list, rinse and repeat. At the end you'll have a mess of data, but it contains everything we need.  I use a try statement here, because the page structure for individual holdings will be different than that of an ETF. If the scrape fails, it means it was an individual stock and that we should move onto the next ticker. Large user inputs could take 30+s because of individual scraping. which wasn't ideal. To get around this, I harnessed asynchronous tasks using the grequests module. This way I can send multiple requests at once.

Prior to this I had made some basic static HTML/CSS only projects, and lots of Java/Python projects in the terminal, but had yet to put them all together on a personal project. A little backstory for this comes in the wake of the COVID-19 outbreak, when stock markets were racing their way to the bottom. I had been very passive and had a financial advisor do all of my investing, and this sudden shock was the impetus needed for me to actually inspect my finances. Long story short I'm now a DIY investor, and do a lot of my investments through ETFs to get broader exposure to the market. However, I still hold some individual stocks, and I was wanting to know what my actual exposure to individual holdings is when summing the input from various ETFs. For example, if you held a tech ETF as well as something like QQQ for broad exposure to the Nasdaq, they both would hold MSFT, AAPL, etc etc. Add that on top of if you individually held some shares of these companies, and suddenly you don't know your true exposure anymore.\r\n\r\nGoogle searching came up with nothing. Lots of sites which will take a stock and return which ETF's contain them with their weight, but nothing that sums up an entire portfolio. Next I thought about making an excel spreadsheet, but that would be extremely laborious. Then I thought about automating it with a Python script! I use Yahoo Finance to keep track of my investments on mobile, which ended up being convenient as it allows you to export your holdings as a .csv. This is extra convenient as it also allows for a standardized input for scaling the app to other user's as well. It started off just running as a command line program, where I would stick my .csv in the same directory as the .py file, and grew from there. Pandas is used to manage all of the data, and imports the .csv with the `pd.read_csv()` module and Beautiful Soup scrapes the holdings. The first step was separate out Canadian and US equities. In Yahoo Finance, all Canadian equities are their ticker, followed by '.TO' or '.V' . I use the exchange rates API to get a live exchange rate. \r\n\r\n```python\r\n     # Seperate Cdn and US equities by defining str\r\n     cdn1 = '.TO'\r\n     cdn2 = '.V'\r\n     # Define live currency exchange\r\n     r = requests.get('https://api.exchangeratesapi.io/latest?base=USD&symbols=CAD')\r\n     j = r.json()\r\n     x = float(j['rates']['CAD'])\r\n     # US/CAD Current Price calculation\r\n     for i in range(0,len(pf['Current Price'])):\r\n     # I assume here if current price exists then a symbol does as well\r\n     # if .TO is not in symbol OR .V is not in symbol, then\r\n          if not cdn1 in pf.at[i,'Symbol'] or cdn2 in pf.at[i,'Symbol']:\r\n          # update price based on exchange rate\r\n               pf.at[i,'Current Price'] = x * pf.at[i,'Current Price']\r\n```\r\n\r\nNext is scraping the ETFs for their inner holdings. This is the meat of the app, and also unfortunately the most prone to breaking if the site providers ever change their structure. I started off by scraping Yahoo Finance themselves, but they only return the top 10 holdings. I later updated to ycharts which returns the top 25. To do this, you just pass the ticker column through a loop into a standard URL format for whatever you're scraping from and use BS4 to return the table containing the holdings. Append this to a master list, rinse and repeat. At the end you'll have a mess of data, but it contains everything we need.  I use a try statement here, because the page structure for individual holdings will be different than that of an ETF. If the scrape fails, it means it was an individual stock and that we should move onto the next ticker. Large user inputs could take 30+s because of individual scraping. which wasn't ideal. To get around this, I harnessed asynchronous tasks using the grequests module. This way I can send multiple requests at once. On my personal portfolio I was using for tests, I brought the processing time down from 40 seconds to 6.\r\n\r\n```python\r\n# This function pulls the URLs which will be scraped from\r\ndef get_URLs(input_data):\r\n    # Initialize empty return variables\r\n    urls = list()\r\n    # Make new DF of symbol column to pull URLs from\r\n    pf = pd.DataFrame(input_data, columns= ['Symbol'])\r\n    for i in range(0,len(pf['Symbol'])):\r\n        # Format symbol column for webscraping\r\n        pf.at[i, 'Symbol'] = pf.at[i, 'Symbol'].replace(\"-\",\".\")\r\n        # Get URL list\r\n        url = ('https://ycharts.com/companies/%s' % pf.at[i, 'Symbol'])\r\n        urls.append(url)\r\n    return urls\r\n```\r\n\r\n```python\r\n# This function converts the input data into the list of holdings and weightings from the ETF Tickers\r\ndef convert(urls, pf):\r\n    # Create empty list of etf holdings\r\n    etf_lib = list()\r\n    # Async requests\r\n    reqs = [grequests.get(url) for url in urls]\r\n    resp = grequests.map(reqs)\r\n    # Parse data tables with pandas and append data to return variable\r\n    for i, r in enumerate(resp):\r\n        get_text = r.text\r\n        try:\r\n            wds=pd.read_html(get_text)[1]\r\n        # This statement skips equities so the scraper can pull ETF data only\r\n        except:\r\n            pass\r\n        else:\r\n            # Logic explained in next section\r\n```\r\n\r\nIn the loop the logic gets a bit tricky. Basically, we take the original dataframe, and iterate through each row. If the row contains an ETF, we append the scraped data to a new list. We then should delete this row from the original dataframe, as the holdings have been accounted for. However, before we do this we need to remember that these sites are only returning the top x holdings, which means there is still y value of unaccounted for holdings left in the ETF. We handle this by subtracting the sum from the value of holdings that were scraped, and then adding this result back to the original data frame with a 'Misc' notation in the name. Once the loop has completed, we first concatenate the list of dataframes together into one large dataframe. Next, we append the original portfolio dataframe to this, as this portfolio now only contains individual holdings and the misc values left in the ETFs. Finally, we take advantage of pandas' `.groupby` and `sum()` functions. This will group all values in the dataframe by a specified column (We'll use the ticker column), and then sums together all values from rows which share the same column value declared by the `.groupby`. We now have the resultant portfolio of individual holdings!\r\n\r\n```python\r\n# Continuing loop above\r\n\t\telse:\r\n        \t# Change scraped data format to match that of YF columns from import\r\n            wds = wds.rename(columns={\"%\\xa0Weight\": \"% Weight\", \"%\\xa0Change\" : \"% Chg\"})\r\n            # Filter col of interest and convert '% Weight' col from str to float, format Symbol col\r\n            for j in range(0,len(wds['% Weight'])):\r\n                wds.at[j, '% Weight'] = wds.at[j, '% Weight'].replace(\"%\",\"\")\r\n                wds.at[j, 'Symbol'] = wds.at[j, 'Symbol'].replace(\"-\",\".\")\r\n            wds['% Weight'] = wds['% Weight'].astype(float)\r\n            # Delete unused data\r\n            del wds['Price']\r\n            del wds['% Chg']\r\n            # Create MISC ticker which represents the % holding of the ETF not accouted for by top 25 holdings\r\n            etft= 100 - wds['% Weight'].sum()\r\n            new_row= {'Symbol':(pf.at[i, 'Symbol']), '% Weight':etft}\r\n            wds = wds.append(new_row, ignore_index=True)\r\n            # Multiply ETF ticker list by weight in portfolio\r\n            wds['% Weight'] = wds['% Weight'] * pf.at[i, '% Weight']\r\n            # Append to list of ETF data and remove ETF ticker from list and remove original ticker entry after it has been parsed\r\n            etf_lib.append(wds)\r\n            pf.drop([i], inplace=True)\r\n    # Concatenate lists together and sum any repeat tickers in list\r\n    df = pd.concat(etf_lib)\r\n    pf['% Weight'] *= 100\r\n    df = df.append(pf)\r\n    # This command will combine repeat tickers and sum their values, but doing so deletes the Name col\r\n    df = df.groupby(['Symbol'] , as_index=False).sum()\r\n    # Final sorted variable containing output\r\n    out = df.sort_values(by = '% Weight', ascending=False)\r\n```\r\n\r\nOne caveat of the `sum()` function is that any string value will also be concatenated. Therefore if MSFT showed up three times, the name column would now read 'MicrosoftMicrosoftMicrosoft'. To get around this, I created a new list which only contains name values which we remove prior to the sum function, and then inject them back in after the summation.  However this created a new problem, the length of the columns change as the summation removes rows. Therefore, my name data wasn't lining up. Using a dictionary with key:value pairs using the ticker and name solved this.\r\n\r\n```python\r\n# Create names dict prior to summation\r\nnames = dict(zip(df['Symbol'], df['Name']))\r\n# Correct name column to values saved in names dictionary\r\nfor i in range(0,len(out['Symbol'])):\r\n    for j in names.keys():\r\n        if str(j) == str(out.at[i, 'Symbol']):\r\n            out.at[i, 'Name'] = names.get(j)\r\n# Re-add ETF Names\r\nfor i in range(0,len(out['Symbol'])):\r\n    for j in etfnames.keys():\r\n        if str(j) in str(out.at[i, 'Symbol']):\r\n            out.at[i, 'Name'] = ('Misc ' + str(etfnames.get(j)) + ' Holdings')\r\n```\r\n\r\nAt this point I now had a program that worked in the terminal. Great, but I wanted to make this a useable service. And so, I started learning Flask! I love how intuitive it is and quick to pick up, and you can create an app in literally 10 lines of code. I ended up with three routes, the index page for uploading, a user printout validating what they uplaoded (If you're interested in this you can check the source code), and a download path for the resulting .csv. I used flask-dropzone to handle the user upload form. The skeleton structure looks something like this:\r\n\r\n```python\r\n# Import libraries\r\nimport os\r\nfrom flask import Flask, render_template, request, make_response, url_for, send_from_directory\r\nfrom flask_dropzone import Dropzone\r\nfrom script import get_URLs, namescrape, print_input, convert\r\n# Create an app instance\r\napp = Flask(__name__)\r\ndropzone = Dropzone(app)\r\n# Update app configuration\r\napp.config.update (\r\n    #UPLOAD_FOLDER = '.\\\\uploads', # Commented out to test\r\n    UPLOAD_FOLDER = '/tmp',\r\n    # Flask-Dropzone config:\r\n    DROPZONE_ALLOWED_FILE_CUSTOM = True,\r\n    DROPZONE_ALLOWED_FILE_TYPE='.csv',\r\n    DROPZONE_MAX_FILES=1,\r\n    DROPZONE_REDIRECT_VIEW= \"download\")\r\n# Main page\r\n@app.route(\"/\", methods =['GET', 'POST'])\r\ndef index():\r\n    if request.method == 'POST':\r\n        #Take CSV input\r\n        filename = 'quotes.csv'\r\n        input_file = request.files.get('file')\r\n        input_file.save(os.path.join(app.config['UPLOAD_FOLDER'], filename))\r\n    # Return template\r\n    return render_template('index.html')\r\n# Download page\r\n@app.route(\"/download\")\r\ndef download():\r\n    # Initialize empty variables for Jinja\r\n    table = ''\r\n    total = ''\r\n    # Read Uploaded data\r\n    input_data = pd.read_csv('/tmp/quotes.csv')\r\n    # Get URLs for scraping\r\n    get_URLs_list = get_URLs(input_data)\r\n    urls = get_URLs_list[0]\r\n    urls2 = get_URLs_list[1]\r\n    # Get Name Data\r\n    names = namescrape(urls)\r\n    # Get data from upload\r\n    userdata = print_input(input_data, names)\r\n    # Store variables\r\n    table = userdata[0]\r\n    total = userdata[1]\r\n    etfnames = userdata[2]\r\n    pf = userdata[3]\r\n    pft = userdata[4]\r\n    # Convert CSV and download result\r\n    output_data = convert(urls2, pf, pft, etfnames)\r\n    output = output_data.to_csv('/tmp/result.csv', index=False)\r\n    # Return template and variables\r\n    return render_template('download.html', table=table, total = total, filename='result.csv')\r\n# Download result route\r\n@app.route(\"/output/<filename>\")\r\ndef output(filename):\r\n    return send_from_directory(app.config['UPLOAD_FOLDER'], filename, as_attachment=True)\r\n# On running server.py, run Flask app\r\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\r\n    # Still under development, run debug\r\n    app.run(debug=True)\r\n```\r\n\r\n```jinja2\r\n    <!--Generate page content-->\r\n    {% if table %}\r\n        <div align = \"center\">\r\n            <style scoped=\"\">\r\n                .button-large {\r\n                font-size: 150%;\r\n            }\r\n            </style>\r\n            <a href=\"{{ url_for('output', filename=filename) }}\"><button class=\"button-large pure-button\">\r\n                <i class=\"fa fa-download\"></i> Download Result\r\n            </button></a>\r\n            <br> or <br>\r\n            <a href=\"{{ url_for('index') }}\"><button class=\"pure-button\"> Return Home\r\n            </button></a>\r\n        </div>\r\n        <div class = \"summary\">\r\n            <h3> This is a summary of what you uploaded: </h3>\r\n            <b>The total portfolio value in $CAD is: {{total}} </b>\r\n        </div>\r\n        <div class = \"pure-table pure-table-horizontal\" align = \"center\">\r\n            {{table|safe}}\r\n        </div>\r\n    {% endif %}\r\n```\r\n\r\nAnd voila! For the HTML baiscally Jinja creates some dynamic functionality by using an `{% if %}` statement on the return variables, so that part of the page content is hidden until the data is generated. Otherwise its pretty basic HTML/CSS but it's functional and doesn't look too bad. I launched it to Heroku, and took advantage of their ephemeral file system to temporaily store the user result. Currently not a very scalable solution, but it works perfectly on the single dyno included with the free plan.

The next week came and our weather window looked good, and more importantly our days off of work aligned. With fresh beta from another friend having done it the previous weekend and lots of traffic on the route, we decided to go for the Garibaldi Neve, which is a point to point 40km ski traverse with ~2000m gain in Garibaldi Provincial Park, starting from the Diamond Head parking lot and exiting at the Rubble Creek trailhead. We agreed on a plan to attempt it in a day, a big goal for us both. Since neither of us had done the route, we both opted to pack bivy gear instead of only emergency equipment, as I suspect we both had the feeling that we had a high chance of getting nighted on the route.\n\nI left Vancouver at 3:30 AM on Saturday morning and made the commute to Squamish, where I met Nelson at the 24 hour McDonalds. Here we grabbed breakfast and left one of the cars. The road up to the Diamond Head was filled with deep muddy ruts from the melt, and we rallied Nelsons Mazda 3 up, luckily only with a few scrapes. We casually geared up in the dark and were on the trailhead a few minutes before 6 AM.\n\n![Imgur](https://i.imgur.com/MIgcjkCh.jpg)\n\nWe set a quick pace skinning by headlamp, arriving at Red Heather in about 50 minutes.

That left me with React/Gatsby which seems like it's the most popular,  or Vue - in which I found VuePress, Nuxt, or Gridsome. I liked Vue over React from the little experience I had, so I started there.

After getting pretty solid with back-end work on some personal web apps using Flask, I wanted to turn my attention towards the ever so trendy JAMstack and new JS frameworks for more front-end experience . Re-writing my wordpress blog from scratch and deploying it as either an SPA or full-static seemed like the perfect choice.\r\n\r\nThat left me with deciding which site generator to use. This whole project started by discovering Jekyll, and discovering how much I liked writing content in markdown. The only thing was that I wanted practice with one of the new JS frameworks and I didn't want my project to be in Ruby. Next I discovered 11ty, which seems awesome, but I wanted to have more of a challenge. That left me with React/Gatsby which seems like it's the most popular,  or Vue - in which I found VuePress, Nuxt, or Gridsome. I liked Vue over React from the little experience I had, so I started there. VuePress doesn't seem as customizable as the other two, and I wasn't wanting to learn GraphQL ontop of a new framework so Nuxt it was. Luckily for me, Nuxt just came out with Nuxt Content and full-static rendering in June, which was absolutely perfect.\r\n\r\nI started plugging away from the boilerplate created by running\r\n`npm create-nuxt-app` and opted in to use Bulma as the CSS framework. Thankfully the Nuxt/Vue documentation is really helpful, as I spent hours going through it  to fully understand each component/module I wanted to add.  Their introduction tutorial [found here](https://nuxtjs.org/blog/creating-blog-with-nuxt-content/) was a lifesaver and worth browsing through if you're interested in using the framework.\r\n\r\nI'm not going to go into too much of the code, since a lot of it was only lightly modified from the tutorial for actually rendering each blog post, but I'll highlight onto what I did add. If you want to go to my repo to view every vue component, all the power to you! The biggest adaptation was adding a /tags path to greatly improve site navigation and organize posts by type. This was as easy as adding a tags object in the markdown YAML, and this vue component:\r\n```javascript\r\n// pages/tags/_slug.vue\r\n<template>\r\n  <div class=\"container journal\">\r\n    <h1>Tags: {{ $route.params.slug }}</h1>\r\n    <ul>\r\n      <li v-for=\"article of articles\" :key=\"article.slug\">\r\n        <NuxtLink class=\"journal-post\" :to=\"{ name: 'blog-slug', params: { slug: article.slug } }\">\r\n          <div>\r\n            <h2 class=\"journal-title\">{{ article.title }}</h2>\r\n            <p class=\"journal-excerpt\">{{ article.description }}</p>\r\n            <span class=\"journal-excerpt\">\r\n              {{ formatDate(article.createdAt) }} &bull;\r\n              {{ article.readingTime }}\r\n            </span>\r\n          </div>\r\n        </NuxtLink>\r\n      </li>\r\n    </ul>\r\n  </div>\r\n</template>\r\n\r\n<script>\r\nexport default {\r\n  methods: {\r\n    formatDate(date) {\r\n      const options = { year: \"numeric\", month: \"long\", day: \"numeric\" };\r\n      return new Date(date).toLocaleDateString(\"en\", options);\r\n    },\r\n  },\r\n  async asyncData({ params, error, $content }) {\r\n    try {\r\n      const articles = await $content(\"articles\", { deep: true })\r\n        .where({ tags: { $contains: params.slug } })\r\n        .sortBy(\"createdAt\", \"desc\")\r\n        .fetch();\r\n      return { articles };\r\n    } catch (err) {\r\n      error({\r\n        statusCode: 404,\r\n        message: \"Page could not be found\",\r\n      });\r\n    }\r\n  },\r\n};\r\n</script>\r\n```\r\nIn the script I also included a small function for date formatting as well as an error catching function. I also added features posts on pages/index.vue by adding a \"featured\" component on the markdown YAML, and the code seen below.\r\n```javascript\r\n// pages/index.vue\r\n<template>\r\n  <div>\r\n    <Hero />\r\n    <h1>Featured</h1>\r\n      <div v-for=\"article of articles\" :key=\"article.slug\">\r\n        <NuxtLink :to=\"{ name: 'blog-slug', params: { slug: article.slug } }\">\r\n          <img :src=\"article.img\" :alt=\"article.alt\" class=\"thumbnail\" />\r\n          <h3 class=\"project-title\">{{ article.title }}</h3>\r\n            <span v-for=\"tag of article.tags\" :key=\"tag.id\">{{tag}}</span>\r\n        </NuxtLink>\r\n      </div>\r\n    <SocialFeed />\r\n  </div>\r\n</template>\r\n\r\n<script>\r\nexport default {\r\n  async asyncData({ $content }) {\r\n    const articles = await $content(\"articles\", { deep: true })\r\n      .where({ featured: { $contains: \"yes\" } })\r\n      .sortBy(\"updatedAt\", \"desc\")\r\n      .fetch();\r\n    return {\r\n      articles,\r\n    };\r\n  },\r\n};\r\n</script>\r\n```\r\nAnother additon is that I added custom error routes, however I can't find the article that I read but if I do I'll add a link to it here.\r\n```javascript\r\n// layouts/error.vue\r\n<template>\r\n  <div class=\"nuxt-error\">\r\n    <component :is=\"errorPage\" :error=\"error\" />\r\n  </div>\r\n</template>\r\n\r\n<script>\r\nimport error404 from \"~/components/error/404.vue\";\r\nimport error500 from \"~/components/error/500.vue\";\r\nexport default {\r\n  name: \"nuxt-error\",\r\n  layout: \"default\", // optional\r\n  props: {\r\n    error: {\r\n      type: Object,\r\n      default: () => {},\r\n    },\r\n  },\r\n  computed: {\r\n    errorPage() {\r\n      if (this.error.statusCode === 404) {\r\n        return error404;\r\n      }\r\n      // catch everything else\r\n      return error500;\r\n    },\r\n  },\r\n};\r\n</script>\r\n```\r\n```javascript\r\n// components/404.vue\r\n<script>\r\nexport default {\r\n  name: \"error-404\",\r\n  props: {\r\n    error: {\r\n      type: Object,\r\n      default: () => {},\r\n    },\r\n  },\r\n};\r\n</script>\r\n```\r\nFinally, for styling I used Bulma.css for this project, which made workflow quick and easy, especially for responsive displays on mobile. The next one I'm looking at checking out is Tailwind.css, there's a ton of Nuxt tutorials out there which are using it. I got some heavy inspiration from [this Gridsome theme](https://gridsome-forestry.netlify.app/) , but since it was written using Gridsome it was fun re-purposing and adapting it to work with Nuxt. It was also really helpful having a visual aid to direct my style decisions, I can see why teams use image templates prior to building.\r\n\r\nAnd that it! In about a week of work I went from an empty VS Code directory to the site you're reading this on now. In the end I ended up rendering it as a SPA, as I was having styling issues and some of my components weren't loading when going full static (Disqus - I'm looking at you).

It's dead simple to use and works, and I don't need a CMS. I can write my .md content on desktop in Typora and push it to GitHub for seamless deployment.  I looked into something like Forestry so I can live preview, but I can achieve the same result by just using `npm run dev` to check followed by `nuxt build && nuxt generate` before committing.\r\n\r\nThanks for reading!

By the time we made it back to Sombrio we had stopped avoiding the mud and had accepted it as our reality. Here we stopped for lunch and refuelled for the second half of the trail.\n\nWith the worst of it behind us the next few beach crossings flew by. However, by the last 10K we were starting to slow down and were definitely feeling the added effort of navigating across all of the logs, branches and mud. Luckily when you travel South to North the trail gets continually easier and we managed to run the entire last portion of the trail from Parkinson to Botanical Beach. We raced each other up the last hill and were completely spent at the finish. Here we met up again with James’ brother who loaded us up with water and snacks for the drive home. FYI, a 2-hour drive in the back of a small car isn’t too kind to sore muscles. Back in Victoria, we hobbled out of the car and hit Bin4 for their late night ½ price burgers where I unapologetically devoured 2 full meals. After I was honestly still hungry, so I think I needed it.\n\nIf you have solid hiking / running experience and you’re fit, I would highly recommend doing this trail in a day. One important thing to note is that this trail is very dependant on the beach crossings, and some areas are inaccessible during high tide. We managed to land on a day where the tides coincided roughly with our rate of travel, so we never had issue. It took us just under 10 hours with a ratio of probably 70% hiking 30% running and never felt too hard, always enjoyable. It makes the muddy sections of trail not seem so long and the ocean vistas are an endless source of motivation. Get after it! Below is an edit I made of our day. I'm really happy with how well I managed considering I only had 12 days to recover in between my first and second ultra!\n\n![Imgur](https://i.imgur.com/4XFZpEYh.jpg)\n\n<center><iframe src=\"https://player.vimeo.com/video/354329672\" width=\"640\" height=\"360\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"autoplay; fullscreen\" allowfullscreen></iframe>\n<p><a href=\"https://vimeo.com/354329672\">Juan de Fuca Run</a> from <a href=\"https://vimeo.com/user80709827\">Will Zittlau</a> on <a href=\"https://vimeo.com\">Vimeo</a>.</p></center>\n\nLink to activity: https://www.strava.com/activities/2549388425\n","dir":"/articles","path":"/articles/juan-de-fuca-in-a-day","extension":".md","slug":"juan-de-fuca-in-a-day","updatedAt":"2020-09-06T22:10:02.948Z","readingTime":"4 min read","meta":{"version":0,"revision":0,"created":1600150576060},"$loki":13},{"title":"Kokanee Glacier Hike","createdAt":"2019-03-31T00:00:00.000Z","description":"Backpacking in paradise","img":"https://i.imgur.com/xgRZ2dRh.jpg","alt":"Kokanee Glacier","featured":"no","tags":["hiking","camping","kokanee glacier","kootenays"],"toc":[],"body":{"type":"root","children":[{"type":"element","tag":"p","props":{},"children":[{"type":"element","tag":"img","props":{"alt":"Imgur","src":"https://i.imgur.com/bd0T8Jgh.jpg"},"children":[]}]},{"type":"text","value":"\n"},{"type":"element","tag":"p","props":{},"children":[{"type":"text","value":"This was one of my unfinished posts way back from two summers ago!

The Snowpatch-Bugaboo col has lost its easy snow slope and is now a steep gully of choss, so we will ascend via the bugaboo glacier. Climbing up the trail to the Kain hut, we followed the moraines to climber's left up to the base of Son of a Snowpatch and skirted its edge to the toe of the glacier. Crampons and axes out, we began up the glacier. As we approached the first plateau, crevasses began appearing in front of us. Luckily at this time of year all the crevasses have opened up and very few have snow bridges left, and the ones that do have obvious sags. We continued, slogging our way up. Finally, past the Pigeon Feathers, we approached a large 'schrund split by a rock island. we managed to find a route through, negotiating a 10 foot wide by hundred foot long gaping maw with no bottom in sight.\n\nBy now the weather was looking worse with looming black clouds ahead of us. We pushed up a snow marine and arrived at the base of the ridge in full winter conditions. Looking across the Vowell, the Howser towers were engulfed in dark storms. From our vantage point, I could tell that the route wasn't going to go today. The upper ridge was caked in verglass and rime, and even the lower slabs were dusted in a thin layer of slippery snice. We scrambled as high as we felt comfortable, maybe 50-100m up the route, before unanimously agreeing to bail. None of us had any winter climbing experience nor ice gear besides long 20cm glacier screws, so for the current conditions, we were ill equipped. Only 3 hours into our day, we causally strolled back down the glacier, glissading the snow slopes when possible and taking photos. There was one tense moment when Colette lost her footing and slipped, separated from her axe which was firmly in place above where she had plunged it. Luckily this was only a moderate snow slope and she quickly managed to arrest herself by kicking in her crampons and grabbing at the snow. Not 10m below was a narrow crevasse.\n\nEventually, we landed back on the plateau. With no other objectives for the day, I suggested we practice crevasse rescues while we had convenient access. Inuk volunteered to rap down off a couple screws, while I prepped a 3:1. I was pleased by the efficiency of it, and hauled up Inuk's 140lb frame with next to no difficulty. On our way back, we hugged Son of a Snowpatch a little tighter, and ended up at a single rap station to get down onto the moraines that led back to the Kain hut.\n\nAfter arriving back at the Kain hut and enjoying the sunshine for a few moments, our relaxation was quickly disrupted by a man frantically waving his arms and whistling from the top of the Dome. Grabbing our packs, we tried our best to jog up the 300m as fast as we could. A lady had tweaked her knee and was unable to put weight on it. However, by the time we had arrived she had already been stabilized and one of the other campers had questionably called a heli in... We bouldered around on the rocks by the camp until the heli arrived and then walked back down to the hut with the camp custodian, who graciously gave use some fresh grown tomatoes once we arrived back. Down back at boulder camp, Inuk and Remi set up a top rope off one of the large rocks above us and began playing around on the moderate routes. Dark fell, it started raining, and it was time for bed.\n\n**Day 3**: Woke up for an alpine start to rain, went back to bed. Set my alarm an hour later and woke up to snow this time, went back to bed. Slept in, it was still snowing, but I eventually hauled myself out of bed. Four of us huddled under a single 5x8 tarp to make breakfast, the typical coffee & oatmeal. After breakfast the fog lifted and we were afforded with a stunning view of all the spires in a fresh coat, glowing in the morning light. We hiked up to the hut and socialized with those inside while enjoying more coffee and reading old stories in the hut's copies of the CAJ.\n\nAround 11am the sun had finally burned up the last of the clouds and it began to warm up, so it was time to move. Today was my last climbing day, with my first day of school starting up in less than 48 hours. Because of the fresh snow we decided not to attempt any of the major spires, but instead set our sights on a 4th class route up above the Dome. We packed our backpacks and headed up again. Within 10 minutes from Applebee, we reached the col that led to the attractive looking blocky NE ridge of Eastpost Spire. Another 10 minutes of scrambling over loose, slush covered rocks and we were at the first set of slabs. One at a time we soloed up and navigated our way towards the snowy summit. Eventually the last pitch presented itself and we made quick work of it, assembling on the summit. It turns out we had climbed the peak in less than 30 minutes, so it was just a tease of climbing in the Bugs, but fun nonetheless.\n\nAfter food and photos we headed back down, route finding made easy with our up tracks embedded in the 4\" of fresh snow. The descent was even faster and in no time we were back at the col. Remi, Inuk and I made a quick detour to the glacial lake above camp and had a very refreshing dip. When we rejoined the group back at camp, they had set up on a perfect splitter on one of the large boulders around camp. Levi got the first send on it and we all projected the climb, with me taking my first real gear fall halfway. Meanwhile, Remi set up an aid line on a thin, broken corner nearby and showed me some aid basics. After this we made the trek back down for dinner, where we were greeted by a massive packrat trying to raid our food. That night, Remi and I set off above our camp for some night photography, with a pristine sky. In bed just before midnight, I fell asleep to the sounds of rockfall echoing off the spires above.\n\n**Day** **4**: Sadly today I had to go home in order to make it in time for classes starting up. I woke up at 5, said my goodbyes to the boys heading out, and returned to bed. Around 8 I stirred again, finished packing up, and made the journey back up to the hut. Here I enjoyed a coffee and reflected on the trip, writing these notes, and started the downhill journey to the car. Letting gravity aid me, I was on the road by 10 and back home in short order.\n\nI cannot wait to return to the bugs with more knowledge and strength, and with better weather. The rock quality truly is pristine and there's a reason why it has gained such international popularity. Until then, the spires will be waiting.\n","dir":"/articles","path":"/articles/lots-of-walking-not-a-lot-of-climbing-in-the-bugaboos","extension":".md","slug":"lots-of-walking-not-a-lot-of-climbing-in-the-bugaboos","updatedAt":"2020-09-07T04:18:38.298Z","readingTime":"8 min read","meta":{"version":0,"revision":0,"created":1600150576102},"$loki":15},{"title":"Marathon day hike: Mount Fosthall","createdAt":"2017-09-21T00:00:00.000Z","description":"First big effort in the backcountry","img":"","alt":"Mt Fosthall","featured":"no","tags":["hiking","mt fosthall","monashees"],"toc":[],"body":{"type":"root","children":[{"type":"element","tag":"p","props":{},"children":[{"type":"text","value":"On this trip we decided to take a break from climbing, and instead made plans on an overnight trip to Monashee Provincial Park, just outside of Cherryville BC.

Don’t catch your carbon pole on a rock while running/sliding down snow (it will explode)\n4. Consult route beta before leaving, and follow the obvious trail unless you want to end up scrambling along a chossy ridge somewhere like us\n\n&nbsp;\n&nbsp;\n![Imgur](https://i.imgur.com/GZ6ja2zh.jpg)\n","dir":"/articles","path":"/articles/marathon-day-hike-mount-fosthall","extension":".md","slug":"marathon-day-hike-mount-fosthall","updatedAt":"2020-09-06T22:16:51.651Z","readingTime":"9 min read","meta":{"version":0,"revision":0,"created":1600150576120},"$loki":16},{"title":"Mt Tupper, West Ridge","createdAt":"2017-09-08T00:00:00.000Z","description":"The story of my first alpine climb","img":"https://i.imgur.com/2QY8HJAh.jpg","alt":"Summit of Mt Tupper","featured":"yes","tags":["climbing","rogers pass","alpine"],"toc":[],"body":{"type":"root","children":[{"type":"element","tag":"p","props":{},"children":[{"type":"text","value":"Me and Quin were gearing up for another work weekend adventure in early July, with big goals in mind.

Mount Tupper sits at 2804 m tall in Rogers Pass BC, an area which hosts endless alpine objectives all year round as well as my favourite ski touring zones. The trip was planned extremely last minute, discussed over broken up texting throughout the day before while at work. After quickly packing we both were ready - alpine racks consisting of 2 sets of nuts, a single rack of hexes, a single rack of cams, 8 or so runners, 2 axes and one 60 m rope, all split between us (definitely a little over kill but it was going to be our first alpine summit). At this point it was already 8PM so by the time we finally got to the pass it was already 11.\n\nOur original plan was to camp at Illecillewaet Campground but unfortunately, it was full. A quick drive over to Loop Brook gave the same results. Not really sure what to do and with no plan C, we kind of just drove around the pass for a while looking for a potential place to camp. Car camping on the highway in national parks is illegal, so we opted to drive back to the entrance of Glacier National Park and find a FSR to camp on.

We were making the most of our two days off  of work, trying to make the Stawamus Chief campsite which closes at 11PM. Getting off at six didn't leave much time for the 450km journey from Kelowna. After making the tactical decision of skipping a drive-through dinner, we managed to arrive at the gates around 10:55PM. For those who don't know, Squamish is a seaport town located along the Sea to Sky Highway between Vancouver and Whistler, and is marked by the giant granite monolith towering above the city known as Stawamus Chief. Squamish should be a destination on any climbers list, offering an abundance of beginner friendly to extremely difficult trad and sport routes scattered upon the chief aswell as the granite walls surrounding the city. As we pulled into one of the last camping spots, we cracked open some beers and gazed at the large dark shadow of granite blotting out the stars, rising up from the trees before us.\n\nThe next morning we discussed our plan of attack while boiling up coffee and oatmeal on the tailgate of my truck. After breakfast we arrived at the smoke bluffs, a series of pleasant crags overlooking the city below. The smoke bluffs offer an easy approach towards a high concentration of single pitch climbs, perfect for re-learning proper crack technique. This would also only be my second day leading trad, so I was a little apprehensive to say the least. However, after a morning full of easy leads up to 5.8 I was starting to feel a lot more comfortable.\n\n![Imgur](https://i.imgur.com/NMq2NcTh.jpg)\n\nWe headed back into town for lunch and enjoyed a wallet friendly value meal from the golden arches before gearing up again. We then headed towards one of the most memorable cracks that I've seen, Exasperator. It is a two-pitch climb following a perfectly cut hand crack that zigzags its way up the otherwise featureless granite until it veers off right into an upwards traverse, and goes at 10a for the first pitch, followed by 10c.\n\nQuin has a tad more climbing talent and confidence than I, and calmly set off up the route making it look relatively easy, albeit strengthy. I opted to follow it on TR, not convinced of my proficiency of placing pro under pressure. This soon turned out to be a wise decision, as my arms quickly pumped out and the climb turned into an all out battle up to the chains - looks like I needed to spend some more time in the gym. The climb consists of rewarding although strenuous finger locks, while the feet are somewhat limited to smearing and edging off of whatever crystals you can find. Finally, just below the chains of the first pitch you are forced into a small cutout in the wall resulting in an insecure mantle, something I imagine would be quite daunting on lead.\n\nI can see why this route made Top 100 Squamish climbs, besides being one of the most aesthetically pleasing splitters that I've seen, it also has fun, quality moves all the way to the top. Next time I'm here I'll definitely have to take my own go at it on lead.\n\n![Imgur](https://i.imgur.com/YTqsLNNh.jpg)\n\nAfter our success on Exasperator we cooled down on the beginner climbs at Murrin Park, practicing top belaying and anchor building before heading to bed. The next morning we were to climb up Skywalker, another Top 100 climb made up of 5 pitches ranging from 5.4 to 5.8 on the large granite face beside Shannon Falls.\n\nWe awoke to the sun shining into the tent, and saw that it was already 9am - not exactly an alpine start. Figuring we were already going to be behind the morning rush at the walls, we casually geared up for the day. Without really consulting the beta on how to reach the base of the route we assumed it was via the main pathways, and followed the crowds of tourists into the park. We quickly realised we were mistaken, as the trails headed away from the granite walls and into the forest towards the falls.\n\nI  definitely felt out of place surrounded by the masses, with full racks hanging from our harnesses loaded with cams, nuts and hexes which banged together with every step. One Asian visitor even proudly proclaimed \"Look, mountain climbers!\" in broken English to his family as we walked by, while another group quickly pointed their DSLRs in our direction followed by the snap of shutters. Back at the truck we consulted our guidebook and found out that the approach actually ran back towards the highway before dipping back up into the forest.\n\nWith our fresh beta we were off and quickly arrived at the base of the wall, and also were greeted with a line up of 3 or 4 parties in front of us.

With swing leads my friend would lead pitches 2 and 4, at 5.8 and 5.6. Soon enough it was my turn and I began up the corner that marked the start of pitch one.\n\nA couple of easy moves brings you up to a bolt at which point you shimmy up a step and transfer out of the corner and into the crack above you to the right. Friendly jamming brings you up this crack to the middle of pitch one, with no obvious cruxes to be had.

This would both be our first ski traverse on the South Coast, and also technically my first ski traverse in general. I've done some hut trips and a few nights of winter camping but until this I hadn't combined them for a point to point overnight ski trip. 35 kms, 2500m ascent, and an uber classic, this was going to be a good introduction to skiing the Coastals.\n\nNelson works as a nurse at VGH, and I'm working a 9-5 at a mechanical engineering co-op currently so our schedules don't often line up. Unfortunately for him, he had the night shift the day before our start. We figured we could do the Spearhead over two days pretty easily even with a little fatigue and planned for this anyways. Nelson's shift ended at 7AM and I was at his place by 8AM. With a two hour commute this meant we weren't in Whistler until a few minutes past 10AM. Do the math, that's not a lot of sleep prior to a big traverse! Regardless, we were in Whistler, and were psyched.

Alpine climbing plans were in the air with Nelson and Quin, but ultimately forecasted rain made us choose a last minute alternative: Bikepacking. And so, Thursday night had me frantically packing my bike for the next day. My phone also happened to die mid-week so it added another layer of complexity only being able to communicate from my laptop (sorry for the lack of photos from this trip, I personally took zero) Friday's work day passed quickly and it was time to head out. After navigating traffic home, I met up with Quin who had made the drive out from Kelowna at my place and we loaded the bikes into the truck. Originally the plan was to just bike from there but the timing of ferries wasn't going to work out so we shuttled downtown and went off from there. The jaunt down to Horseshoe Bay was uneventful albeit fast paced as we raced to catch the earlier sailing. Down at the ferry we met up with Nelson who had been a few minutes ahead of us, and boarded.\n\nAlready well past dark, once off the ferry we biked up to the nearest FSR that we found on maps.
